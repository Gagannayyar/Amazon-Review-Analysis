0,Customer care response time,"Customer care response time very bad , not able to fix my issue last 1 month. Do not use more neu app "
1,order confirmation,"Your app is not as user friendly as I would have liked it to be. I have not spoken with any customer care executives, except chat automated response systems.I am unable to navigate the site while trying to get my selected items from my cart, towards the order confirmation and payments transactions page. I have been wanting to place further orders, but I am not able to move my selected and shortlisted items from my cart to the next step of confirming my delivery address and selection of payments options "
1,order confirmation,Delivery timeline at time of ordering was 19th April and post order confirmation and payment it was changed to 22nd April. Not only is this misleading the customer but also providing inaccurate information. Further the Neu pass which is highlighted in your marketing campaigns seem to be not working properly at the back end. Didnâ€™t get any instant credits for my recent purchase on the platform. Hope this feedback is actioned upon and timely resolved
1,order confirmation,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
1,order confirmation,"My money is stuck with you with no order confirmation. And despite calling so many times, no clarity is being provided"
1,order confirmation,No resolution to the complain.Still not able to get the order confirmation though transaction is successful on 18th May and next one on 20th May.

3,shoe order,I have wasted my 2 weeks by purchasing from neu very bad experience it took 2 weeks for shoe order but still not delivered they cancelled it
4,cusomer care eecutive,"So far interacted with BigBasket only. The cusomer care eecutive has not been able to resolve any of the issues even after 4/5 days. Delivery id terribly delayed and in bad shape.
Very painful specially as I am myself a ex-Tata executive."
5,Customer care,"Customer care response time very bad , not able to fix my issue last 1 month. Do not use more neu app "
5,Customer care,Customer care is not great. I don't have time to give screenshotsof my chat and spend time. Even app is weird. Not allowed to cancel. Big price variation in less than 24 hours 10% variance
5,Customer care,"Customer care service is too bad in Tatanew. Usually, I won't trust any new application. But I trusted you because its a tata group. Now the service is worst"
5,Customer care,Customer care not taken immediate action.
5,Customer care,"Customer care was of no help , No clarity "
5,Customer care,Very Worst experience. Customer care don't know what to do. It took 20days to resolve one issue that too I have followed n number of times. 
5,Customer care,"More than Customer care, it's the basic order processing & delivery issue, poor reflection of the status in your Tata Neu app. is the fundamental problem, Customer care can not handle the basic issues with order fulfillment & delivery."
5,Customer care,"The app needs lot of improvement, hangs, lags a lot. Not user friendly. Customer care needs to be efficient. Bad experience while shopping. More than half of my orders got cancelled without notice. Have a look at amazon, flipkart. Better offers, better app. I have love for tata brand, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m using this app. Otherwise itâ€™s not worth. Everybody i know has same feedback."
5,Customer care,"Customer care dont't know any thing , then the standard reply, for this we don't need customer care."
5,Customer care,I had ordered groceries which did note deliver on time. Customer care told me it is out for delivery and will reach within 30 minutes. Which never happened and i had to ultimately cancel the order the next day. 
5,Customer care,"Your customer care executive is looking the order#TC300030608681 status in the application & provide me the details. I can very well see it. However, my issue was need to know why the above mentioned order was not delivered on time & why people are not updating? Due to this reason Amazon is doing better business than TATA. Why can't I rely on TATA...area of improvements are as follows:
1. Team should update order status on time
2. Customer care executive should be provided detailed information about logistic part
3. They should have ability to connect with internal team to know real cause of the issue
4. Your customer relationship manager must review each & call to know what is happening at ground level
5. TCS should upgarde their software according to business requirements must provide escalation matrix in the NEU apps"
5,Customer care,Something wrong with the payment mode. Customer care weâ€™re not helpful at all
5,Customer care,Customer care said gift card will be issued but I have not yet received 
5,Customer care,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
5,Customer care,Customer care executive was polite and called back. But there was a delay of two days after which they told me to mail my query via a different email . Was a waste of time .
5,Customer care,Customer care executive was perfectly doing her job. 
5,Customer care,My first impression was the last impression. Customer care executive where I'll informed about the issue.
5,Customer care,Customer care is ok but application problem booking not confirmed account deduction 
5,Customer care,Your Customer care executive was replying me very slowly. So maintain your service so that time of customer seeking for customer care help will be saved. 
5,Customer care,Issue was resolved but it took more time than expectation. Customer care executive does not have the sufficient information related to issue because they said it was handled by croma team. 
5,Customer care,I registered my complain on Tata new app .. Customer care executive call me everyday but .. service of repairing taken almost 5-7 days ..service conducted but problem still running ... no solution at all.. service man just advised us unnecessary things how to use . but problem still remains ... no solution at all.. very poor service from Tata product Chroma.. not expected at all
5,Customer care,"Maintain audit trail of changes made to order
Customer care executives need to be more polite and dynamic to handle customer queries"
5,Customer care,Customer care executive was not properly prepared to answer. He always took time to answer. While I asked him simple questions.
5,Customer care,Customer care can't do anything if the payment system doesn't work 
5,Customer care,Customer care executive behaviour was excellent and responsible.
5,Customer care,Customer care me koi bat sunta hi nhi or jab mera order complete hua uske 2 din bad order cancel kar Diya kyuki price high krne k bad  or mere ko bolte he aapko refund milega AAP dusra order kr lo order karke mere ko 600 ki nuksani
5,Customer care,Customer care executive should be able to resolve the issue rather than asking customer to wait for call back
5,Customer care,"Customer care service is too fast my problem is solved in chat but they call me to sure that really my problem is solved or not . really a good customer service now i am a permanent user of tata app.

                                   Thanku sir/mam"
5,Customer care,Customer care interaction was good
5,Customer care,Customer care executive was brilliant but your system/app is faulty. I was unable to find my order details which I ordered 4-5 months before. And also executive was unable to find the same.. 
5,Customer care,"Customer care cannot solve a single issue. Giving useless suggestion. Trashy app, trashy customer care "
5,Customer care,"Customer care service is worse & it's executives are also not fully trained to handle the issues raised and are keen to resolve it. Just handle the customers like ping pong ball, here - there... "
5,Customer care,Customer care executive was good but still issue is not resolved and neu coins are yet to be refunded
5,Customer care,Very Good support from Customer care people. My complaint was resolved smoothly without any issue.
5,Customer care,Customer care shall be easily accessible and they should nott ask for sensitive information for verifying user
5,Customer care,Have not received any call / response to my email from Tataneu Customer care team. Pl have the query raised in my email responded
5,Customer care,Customer care is very bad
5,Customer care,Customer care are good but you technical team is not work fast or resolve issues fast
5,Customer care,Customer care especially for westside sucks
5,Customer care,"Customer care rep was not bothered about solving the issue , they just wanted to close the ticket and move on. Very disappointing experience"
5,Customer care,Customer care executive doesn't have knowledge to resolve my query. I am very much dis-satisfied with Tata neu. I don't recommend using this app.
5,Customer care,Customer care just can create service request. No resolution.
5,Customer care,Customer care executive understood my query but it took very long time to resolve my query and it is not yet resolved yet
5,Customer care,"Exttemely bad experience on a simple query raised on the status of my membership. Customer care executives have very limited or no knowledge at all, not of TATA standard where proper training of the customer facing people had always been of utmost importance."
5,Customer care,"Customer care representative are not responding properly on time.. it taking time to respond, issue also not resolved properly"
5,Customer care,Customer care not responding and i ordered 6to8pm still not get now time is 9;53pm Stupid response this is How can i order next
5,Customer care,Mr.Javed Customer care executive he deserve 5 stars for service
5,Customer care,"Customer care is not reading the mail properly. If not understanding , please come back . But don't give reply which for which the query not raised. I have asked something, customer care is replying other things."
5,Customer care,App provide features to refer a friend but when my friend was trying to login then there was no option to login via reffere code. Customer care told me this feature will be stopped after 7th april that why you are facing this issue but my concern is why there is an option to refer a friend if we cannot use it . Any change in app should go after validation each point.
5,Customer care,Customer care saying you can login 8 April so I am login on the date hope full login to Tata neu and there facilities
5,Customer care,Best Customer care service.
5,Customer care,Customer care not solve my query
5,Customer care,Customer care is zero.Simply passing and wasting time
5,Customer care,Customer care did not contact me
5,Customer care,Not able to resolve my issue. My amount was debited twice and order was not placed. Customer care also is unresponsive.
5,Customer care,Customer care service is good. But need improvement in App
5,Customer care,Customer care has no clue what the problem is
5,Customer care,Customer care excutive is not updated
5,Customer care,Not good Customer care
5,Customer care,My issue not resolved. Customer care blocked my mail id also.
5,Customer care,Customer care executive should understand better about TATA neu reward program.
5,Customer care,Tata Neu is a misleading initiative. I purchased a product and it had multiple Order IDs.. for none I received the Neu Points.. Customer care can't help and it's useless to spend time with them.
5,Customer care,Multiple order Ids have been generated and there is no intimation of the Neu points to be credited. Customer care is not able to help too. Pathetic campaign and no system to resolve to issues.
5,Customer care,Worst Customer care. No information provided at all
5,Customer care,Customer care executive mislead me...... There is no facility to make payment via UPI which is strong negative for the App.... Keeps throwing out of the App ....
5,Customer care,Your app is too slow . Customer care service also needs improvement.
5,Customer care,"I recharged my Jio prepaid mobile no 9810448282 from Neu App, for Rs 666 ( 84 days plan) It is not recharged and debited from my card. Customer care says its recharged whereas Iâ€™m unable to call anyone including your customer care"
5,Customer care,I am unable to change my name. Customer care gives false promises. Very disappointed
5,Customer care,"My problem is still not resolved, Customer care person is working on that , he had given assurance on resolution."
5,Customer care,"Customer service needs to be more swift.Hope in the future the service would be more quick and the app becomes more smoother without any lag and no payment issues.I would like to highlight one thing - Customer care call service is pathetic , it must be improved. 4 - 5 times I placed a call, one single guy took the call every time.He spoke in a regional language-hindi.I asked him to speak in english or give to someone who knows english so I can communicate easily.He refused and disconnected the call(after 2-3 attempts).First thing i guess there is insufficient people in the call service team since all the 4-5 times the same person spoke and second thing the person attending should sound polite or atleast sound professional.More than anything ""service"" is something important, which makes the customer visit again.If its not improved, then its difficult to sustain in the competitive environment.That too being from India's PROUD ""TATA"" brand, I wish to see this platform grow thousandfold and flourish successfully! So, please work on the customer service and improve the platform's issues/glitches that is present currently. from a RATAN TATA's Fan"
5,Customer care,Have been raising issues of non crediting of points for my stay at Taj Exotica Goa over last 3 weeks. The issue is yet to be resolved. The Customer care is reluctant to put me on to the floor manager or give me escalation matrix. Further more email written on 26th Apr too has not been replied
5,Customer care,Customer care never contacted only
5,Customer care,still my account is not delete... Useless Customer care service..Some Customercare Executive Spoil the TATA Brand Names... HATE this really No One is not Still Reply But why close my ticket.. First Respect Customers Do some work for Your salary..
5,Customer care,Customer care support doesn't know the the actual which was raised.
5,Customer care,Customer care executive was not knowing about Big Basket promotional offer. You can read all the details in whats app chat.
5,Customer care,My order was supposed to be delivered by 2/may/2022. I still have not received it despite on continuous followups with customer care. I was promised by croma team my order would be delivered by 3/May/2022 and nothing happened. I received call today from Bluedart couriers and they said order will be delivered today (5/may/2022) and it still is not delivered. I was not being informed about delay in my order which is highly unsatisfactory. Had to multiple follow ups to get above info. Customer care representative was not able to provide me â€œgrievance email idâ€. Overall experience has been very bad and i wont be ordering anything from Tata Neu in future. In the age where you get groceries delivered in hours a Big brand like Tata is not able to deliver my order is simply unacceptable.
5,Customer care,Customer care number required
5,Customer care,Customer care number is not rechable
5,Customer care,"Tata neu Customer care service is good. But Delivery Product return or replacement processing is very bad. So, correction to return or replacement process."
5,Customer care,Customer care doesnâ€™t have the proper information
5,Customer care,Waited for long time Customer care person not responded
5,Customer care,Customer care officers strongly trying resolve my issue.. Thanking you Sir/Madam
5,Customer care,Poor app. Very slow. Payment not easy on the app. Tata pay never works. Not easy navigating the app. Customer care only trained to give standard generic reply. Long was to go before you can compete with rivals.
5,Customer care,I believe Customer care executive has limited access to back end systems and thus takes long time. (More than 10 minutes at times) to understand the customer query
5,Customer care,"I have placed an order from Tataneu in Croma online, money was debited from my account, transaction was successful but the order was not placed. Customer care was not able to help with the issue, they say issue was escalated to concerned team and it'll take 3days to resolve. Why do you need 3 days to check on a simple issue with a transaction?"
5,Customer care,"Customer care executive in chat was not having clarity, informed me to confirm order number, but with the order number only chat was selcted. I informed that, if I move out from chat to check order number, ongoing chat will be lost, but I was insisted to mention order number. I went back in app to view order number, ongoing chat was lost and same could not be traced back. Overall a frustrating experience. Take immediate corrective actions"
5,Customer care,"I did not receive 5% neu coins after ordering grocery worth 850 from tata neu app. Customer care told â€˜Sir there is nothing we can do about this, our system is showing you did not order from tata neuâ€™ This is the resolution I received Good luck to tata neu team."
5,Customer care,Product is good but Tata Neu / Croma need to take ownership for the delivery date which they promise... Promising next day delivery and delivering after 3 days Customer care guys dont have much to do except telling what is already known to customer
5,Customer care,Customer care executive is in regional language will be more effective....
5,Customer care,Customer care team did not apply their mind to resolve the issue. It looks like they are sticking to the given script rather than solving the issue. I have not received Neucoins for the transaction with Air Asia apparently because one system takes into account middle name while the other does not. This is a very bad way of textual comparison. Even the government agencies understand this and it was never expected of a Tata company.
5,Customer care,Customer care shld listn. Observe. Understand. Simple things go for
5,Customer care,Customer care has no clue about timelines and has very bureaucratic approach. Just focus on forwarding complaints. Back end not integrated - Neu and brand do not talk to each other
5,Customer care,Customer care executive was not controlling croma technician. Croma technician was rude. Installation was not standard as per my suggestion and compare to other AC at my home. Technician was also not ready to learn any new thing and was doing work as per his mood.
5,Customer care,"Customer care person through chat is passing time with words like sorry, inconvenience look like nto,send screenshot etc.No soution,no resul t. After that referring the matter to our competent team which never replied back."
5,Customer care,"The Customer care representative's effort to verify my identity was more and solving the issue was NIL.The rescheduling of collection of sample should have been easily confirmed. Once Ticket number of the complaint is generated and quoted by me for follow up from registered mobile number, there must be no further wastage of time and it could have nbeen rescheduled based on available slots. They really wasted my time , You need to averhaul the procedure to be more efficient."
5,Customer care,Very bad service..pathetic Customer care staff...
5,Customer care,Customer care executive not understand the problem
5,Customer care,Customer care agent didnâ€™t solve my query
5,Customer care,The staff in the Customer care needs to be sensitized on various earlier rewards schemes / offers / amendment in master details of customers ..... The current lot seem to be out of school and working in a management seat.................
5,Customer care,Customer care service opretor very copretive
6,cash back,They didn't explain me the cash back offer & also have me false commitment of getting me a call back from some one right person & also I've not recieved any email regarding the same as they stated. 
6,cash back,I think you have to start referel services to more customers and also cash backðŸ’µðŸ”™ is better option to satisfy your customers. 
6,cash back,"Incorrect offer mentioned on website. This is regarding Hdfc offer on Samsung s22+ mobile. The customer care executive also incorrectly told me that the offer is for cash back, when it is clearly mentioned as instant discount. "
6,cash back,Very poor timely response and my issue is closed without proper evidence and cash back not issued to me.
6,cash back,Thanks for the prompt service. I got Neu coins and 5% delivery cash back as well thank you.
6,cash back,"All of your processes are flawed , forat your system breaks the order in two parts on its own and hence you donot honour the cash back scheme. After mentioning this to your customer supports they open a ticket and this ticket is still open for more than 40 days without an ETA. So its not the problem with customer support guys they are helpless in front of your flawed system"
6,cash back,Recently I ordered a Iphone 13 128 GB. I ordered with No Cost Emi and hdfc instant cash back offer but both of not received. I had challenges to get a update from customer care. Finally I have to return the product.. it was a bad experience
6,cash back,Worst customer service experience. One query had to be raised multiple times. I feel cheated being a Neu customer my 5% cash back was stolen by the company in the name of mismatch. Worst Managed company will never avail any service in future. Regret taking Air Asia flight with the intent of receiving 5% cash back which was cheated by Neu Management got nothing in the name of cash back
6,cash back,"Your apps experience Good but light bill, telephone bill, postpaid bill, Insurance premium, Money transfer, Book my show and PVR, bus booking, Mobile recharge, DTH all services available and cash back offer total service your tata neu apps"
6,cash back,I purchased a phone from tata croma at 24th of march . At that time the store manager promised me if i take the phone i will get cash back from tata neu in 16 days . I was fake marketed by tata croma to make the bill . It was not the way to do the sales . Now they are telling at that time tata neu app was not active . I had many other options to buy electronics. But i preferred tata croma . Because i was trusted for the reputation. But this is very wrong . To mislead the customer with fake promises . Never expected this from a tata enterprise
6,cash back,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
6,cash back,"It was not so plesent experience, its been 2 months from check out and am struggling to get cash back,"
7,price variation,Customer care is not great. I don't have time to give screenshotsof my chat and spend time. Even app is weird. Not allowed to cancel. Big price variation in less than 24 hours 10% variance
8,referel services,I think you have to start referel services to more customers and also cash backðŸ’µðŸ”™ is better option to satisfy your customers. 
9,Tata Neu,"Very bad service of Tata Neu 
No resolution "
9,Tata Neu,Sir I bought grocery from Big Basket thru Tata Neu on 28/07/22. Some item pack was vaccum leaked. 
9,Tata Neu,Very very worrest App Tata Neu and customer service 
9,Tata Neu,"The Big Basket application within Tata Neu  was a complete disappointment.  In the first try, I paid through NUE coins and cash. but the process aborted. I then had to pay cash all over again. I have now lost the NUE coin credit. 
when the delivery boy came he said he had double the order and he had brought them. I said I did not want it and he took them.away but I have not got the credit for the Neu coins."
9,Tata Neu,Simply she saying my voice is not clear.  I requested her see email sent to bigbasket and 1mg. Also informed to her when I received conformation email for update of mobile number why it is reverted.  There is no proper response simply saying my voice is not clear.  However I again sent email to Tata Neu Customer Care please see and do the needful.
9,Tata Neu,Pathetic Service from Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
9,Tata Neu,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
9,Tata Neu,Overall Tata Neu is good quality service to customers and resolving issues immediately by constantly following up the issues in resolving but in bigbasket restocking the items notifications not coming to registered email to customers whenever products going out of stock in bigbasket 
9,Tata Neu,"This is a serious gap in Tata Neu this help service as well the platform requires creative mind who can walk through different aspect of customer problems. At present ""it is I do not know or you have to check with another part in the platform'"
9,Tata Neu,"Cannot expect such slow poor and delayed service from a Tata enterprise. Even the Tata Neu application has a lot of snags 
 "
9,Tata Neu,I have quit Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,Extremely disappointing....Definitely my last through Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,"More than Customer care, it's the basic order processing & delivery issue, poor reflection of the status in your Tata Neu app. is the fundamental problem, Customer care can not handle the basic issues with order fulfillment & delivery."
9,Tata Neu,"I think, the customer care executive was really trying, but just saying I understand your problem, I am sorry for it a hundred times, doesn't help. They need to know how to solve the problems.I think the systems are not smooth as before. It took me a whole morning to order something through Tata Neu that would have taken me 5 -10  minutes max on any other platform"
9,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is a great app but it will become superapp when it runs superfast speed. I am telling that because the app does not run smoothly.  
In electronics section, sometimes it runs good not very good but sometimes not. Sometimes entrie app goes on slow mode. I have been feeling laggy experience on Tata Neu. To compete with e-commerce giant , Tata nue will have to be smooth, lag free. 

My review on invoice :- I have not found any option in ordered section of the app where I can download my invoice of my product. The invoice which I gave got from Tata Neu is not in any downloadable format eg:- PDF or word etc. So I hope, In the next update  
I can see invoice features and lag free experience.
    ""Tata Neu the app for every Indian.""
     ""Tataâ™¥ï¸the brand of every Indian.""
                   Thank you!

9,Tata Neu,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
9,Tata Neu,Thanks to all the customer care executives for prompt support each time. Heartily thanks to Grievance officer Tata Neu. Wishes all the very best to wonderful team of Croma. Keep it up. 
9,Tata Neu,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"
9,Tata Neu,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
9,Tata Neu,I chased for my refund for more than 2 months and I gave up. I am no more interested in pursuing for my refund. Very very disappointed with Tata Neu.
9,Tata Neu,I keep facing issues with the Tata Neu App. It gets issues every time I use it 
9,Tata Neu,"Thank you for quick resolution of my issue. But I think integration between other tata apps and tata neu needs improvement. Sometimes big basket, tata play or 1mg doesn't open from Tata Neu though these work properly from individual apps. "
9,Tata Neu,Trust Broken by Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,I was not allowed to explain the issue clearly and 2-3 calls and emails from the customer support team explaining what they think the issue was and the best part was no resolution except saying try JustPay which i have no clue what is it...Anyways stopped using Tata Neu unless i am forced to and using other apps which are quite smooth...Listen to the customer first rather than trying to be oversmart...
9,Tata Neu,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily
9,Tata Neu,"Cromartie executive didn't know the details of Tata Neu app,how customers would benefit from the app."
9,Tata Neu,"Due to error in spelling of name ( your side) in my profile, could not book flight and lost out on Neucoins. This was my first attempt at using Tata Neu and hence discovered error now only. Had to book flights thru MMT"
9,Tata Neu,"Freecharge is accepted in Big basket, why not on Tata Neu? "
9,Tata Neu,"The worst shopping and customer care experience ever! Never shopping from Tata Neu again. Just to get an update on my order, it took more than 72 hours. Plus my order did not even get delivered. My refund has not been initiated. The customer care executive I spoke to first did not even understand the issue and says things like because a sale is ongoing on Westside products they couldn't handle my order. If an order cannot be handled by such a big brand it's better to shut it down for good. Never shopping from you and I am going to spread the word among my friends and family as well."
9,Tata Neu,worst service ever experienced with any Tata org... have to improve lot with Tata Neu else dont know where this land...ridiculous in one word
9,Tata Neu,"You have a pathetic platform where you want people to come and spend time placing the orders while the payments in your backend get stuck. I ended up placing 2 orders via Tata Neu where payment was deducted from my bank and order never got processed. The customer care executive hardly cared and told this is backend issue, please place a fresh order. Also, the 5%cashback which is promised on your platform does not seem to be a realty as you can check for yourselves based on the order from my account registered with the number 9916785363."
9,Tata Neu,Even to take back a defective product it took several days by your team and I was only receiving emails after emails but no action. Now there is no noise about refund of my money. Tata Neu is a colossal failure I believe and would strongly advise my acquaintances to avoid using it for online purchase and prefer Amazon and Flipkart for their outstanding services. 
9,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu has passed on the losses due to its portal glitch, over to me. This resulted in my Harrassment and TATANEU keeping my payment without delivering me the products. "
9,Tata Neu,"Software part of Tata Neu has many Glitches, to be addressed at earliest"
9,Tata Neu,Same repeated issues and customer care representative have no adequate knowledge about the issues and Tata Neu overall app. The App has lots of bugs and there is no efforts either to understand or solve the issues. Very pathetic app   
9,Tata Neu,"Pathetic pathetic pathetic pathetic service by Tata Neu. My order was delivered on Wednesday and till Saturday Installation has not happened. I need compensation of Rs 5,000 for delay in installation. I have not received installation SMS also till today. Whereas other online company as well as Croma is also providing installation of electronic product in 24 hours. "
9,Tata Neu,It is a good system for material supply from warehouse with minimum staff and without physical opening the stores whereby Tata Neu can offer larger discounts. But today after receiving my order I found that in some of the items MRP was charged vide order no. TN-1079755674-20221027. Please also add more varieties of tea and other things. 
9,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu app is slow in my phone. Otherwise, I just have positive feedback."
9,Tata Neu,Thank you so much Deepak & Tata Neu team 
9,Tata Neu,"As, of now. No
My concern was 250 NeuCoins.
As I discussed with excutive, I will be eligible if purchased thorough Tata Neu before 21st.
I hope I will earn."
9,Tata Neu,"Hi Tata Neu Team

Thanks Nikhil Asopa for addressing my concern and resolving it up to expectation. Thouth it was resolved, the process of getting support was not easy, many people were involved in communication which was quite time consuming and frustrating, resolution process might be quite simpler.

Prakash"
9,Tata Neu,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address..!!?? Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good."
9,Tata Neu,Make Tata Neu app faster. It lags way too much to be usable.
9,Tata Neu,Useless. Never shop again on Tata Neu 
9,Tata Neu,Your Tata Neu is hopeless.They could not solve my problem .Finally Bigbasket daily executive advised to update the app through play store.I did it and problem is over.
9,Tata Neu,Improve Tata Neu payment method with tata pay upi.
9,Tata Neu,"I was given good amount of explanation on my query.  Although, I was not very satisfied after placing the order because I received a text message from Croma asking that the payment was not completed and they provided a new link for payment (also tata new app said product not processed until 1 day after purchase). I had purchased the product using Tata Neu App and no Cost EMI option. It is confusing for the customer and might end up paying twice for the product. After the call, I am assured that the product purchase is completed and it is in shipped status. Eagerly waiting for the product to get delivered. Thank You Team."
9,Tata Neu,"I am really sad to learn the pathetic service from Tata Neu whether its customer care executive or your delivery partner. If you cannot provide me the service than why the hell you take the order and money. You have my address and every other detail , and you should first ascertain the fact first. I need the mobile on very urgent basis but because of your poor and degraded service i am unable to get it now and more so my money is also blocked which i cant use to purchase from some where else. Thanks and regards. My only advise would be to improve your self  bcoz this sought of harassments would really affect the reputation of your brand Tata Neu"
9,Tata Neu,"I tried to explain to each agent that I had not cancelled the Croma Order after paying the total amount by Credit Card and that there was a fraud being committed at either Croma or in the NeuCoins department of Tata Neu, but nobody has taken it seriously. I have bee defrauded of 120 - 6 = 114 New Coins"
9,Tata Neu,I was struggling to get confirmation on my orders placed on Big Basket through the very slow Tata Neu App. My payments were debited & I did not get any invoice over email or app when I asked for it
9,Tata Neu,Purchases at Westside stores not getting integrated in Tata Neu. Call Centre has no visibility to this and ask for physical receipts.
9,Tata Neu,It took them over 2 weeks just to inform me that a Covid RT-PCR test through Tata 1mg app does not contribute towards Tata Neu Coins. Expect better from such a reputed company.
9,Tata Neu,"You guys are useless, issues spanned for more than 2 months and I still dont have refund. Never ordering from Tata Cliq or Tata Neu again in my life"
9,Tata Neu,I had placed my query on 18th June. Itâ€™s already 24th June now. They are still stalling my issue and not giving any resolve. Pathetic customer service and pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Worst platform to buy anything.
9,Tata Neu,"I was told to share the screenshot of the problem I had raised. Am email was supposed to be send by Tata Neu, in which I had to share the screenshot. However, I didn't receive any email or link."
9,Tata Neu,"However, the bills paid in the Taj Hotels bars after discounts during happy hours do not qualify for Tata Neu points. This must be rectified."
9,Tata Neu,"I had a worst experience with Tata Neu. First purchase and you lost me as a customer and I ever interact with anyone. I won't purchase a thing from here. Never going to suggest to purchase. Customer support not one multiple worthless. Knowledge less. They are supposed to know that discount price and no cost emi upfront waiver is from merchant itself not bank. Even after making them understand they routed me to bank. I'm waiting for a reply from Neu otherwise you soon be getting a legal notice from consumer court, filed by mem worst place to purchase. Never visting again"
9,Tata Neu,Unable to use NEU coins on big basket and now coins will expire without me availing benefit called both Big Basket and Tata Neu but issue not yet resolved
9,Tata Neu,"Problem Not resolved It. I am not able to make Payment. I also pay my electric Bill but this month onward , I have to go through other payment portal because of this problem. Being a Tata Steel Employee this is unfortunate for me. I am not able to use Tata Neu."
9,Tata Neu,"The issue was not all resolved, till date. Requesting the Tata Neu Team to kindly resolve the issue and refund the cancellation amount of Rs.262 to Credit card and 37 Neu Coins."
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu app is a good initiative & offers great benifits to customer. Moreover it is very user friendly.
9,Tata Neu,Wishing the entire Tata Neu team all the very best. May you beat Amazon (also Reliance- the unreliable) and rule India with the maximum market share. Best wishes from a Tata loyalist and shareholder!
9,Tata Neu,Sorry to say no one has called me nor have replied to my query. Contacting and communication was easy with Taj Inner Circle group earlier. Tata Neu app is horrible and cannot resolve or refer to specific questions .

9,Tata Neu,Bad that policies are changed and you could buy directly from BB and get Tata Neu points and now you must from directly Tata Neu app but is not informed that this change has happened.
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu and Tata Pay require lot of attention. Payment got stuck multiple time. APP gets hang in between
9,Tata Neu,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
9,Tata Neu,No proper response. Website not friendly. Tata Neu only wants to Apply for loans and not provide EMI Card.
9,Tata Neu,"Hi, This Is Vardhan Varma Penmetsa. I just Interact With Tata Neu Customer Care Service And The Person From Tata Neu Care End Was Responded Promptly And Sort Out My Issues. Thanks A Lot To Customer Care Executive Woo Responded Immediately And Solve The Issues And Wishing All Success To Team Tata Neu. Thank You So Much ? ?"
9,Tata Neu,"The Response is simply awesome, Thank You So Much And Wishing You All Success To Team Tata Neu.??"
9,Tata Neu,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
9,Tata Neu,Need to more quick respond in Tata Neu because its taking so much time.
9,Tata Neu,Really nice support is provided by Tata Neu support team.
9,Tata Neu,Dear Tata Neu welcome to new digital services We always with you We will remember your social services
9,Tata Neu,very bad experience...i am not getting my Tata Neu Coins... already raised complaint but no solution... only saying we are working on it.it had been 1 week...
9,Tata Neu,excellent. anyhow my problem is not resolved yet. My Tata 1mg cash could not be carried forwarded to Tata Neu Coin yet. Hope let me wait for some more days to to resolve this
9,Tata Neu,Worst experience with Tata Neu ordering. It took 1 hour on chat to make him understand the issue. It would have been better to talk instead of chat for an hour.
9,Tata Neu,"Grocery part is not accessible, app gets hanged in the case of clicking Grocery. For some other items also App gets hanged. Secondly I am having 2 Accounts of Tata 1 mg and I have been operating the one with Mobile No. 9981491770. (Email id daudchoudhary@gmail.com. I want this account be merged with Tata Neu App with Mobile No. 9424442773 (email id -daudchoudhary@yahoo.com), but somehow it is not getting done. Earlier also I requested to chnage my mobile no. From 9981491770 to 9424442773, but I was informed it is not possible. If it isnot possible, atleast transfer all my Orders and Prescriptions to the Account with Mobile No.9424442773, for records."
9,Tata Neu,"At least there should be a way to resolve the issue than letting the customer to figure out what should be done. The call as well as the email response was below expectations. My belief that Tata would be ae to take on Amazon lies in vain, I dont think from my experience. Even Flipkart fares below Amazon in meeting customer expectations. Tata Neu has failed to impress me, franky speaking."
9,Tata Neu,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu coins not received even after raising ticket twice. Please resolve Ticket #720576 asap.
9,Tata Neu,No solution with your representatives. Even they don't know about Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,I am not satisfied because I have made a big purchase only few weeks before launch of Tata Neu and I am not getting any Neu coins for that purchase. I am not likely to make such a big purchase again in the next 3-4 years so I feel I have missed out on the benefit of Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
9,Tata Neu,"1) Prepaid Recharge function not working properly. 2) Tata Pay options not found in the payment menu. Somehow this important feature is missed. 3) In Big Basket Tata Neu payment option is not working. When we choose initially Cash on Delivery. 4) Neu Points should accept the decimals. Otherwise, the bill value should get convert to next higher number for us to use Neucoins. 5) Overall introduced in a hurry, always asking for a screenshot and it is really frustrating. 6) Hope someone at the top level sees the comment and take corrective action."
9,Tata Neu,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
9,Tata Neu,I HAVE BEEN USING TATANEU FROM PAST 4 TO 5 MONTHS..Tata Neu is getting stuck/Hanged a lot ...it taking time to load ....please work on it .It is very beneficial app...but its affecting the enjoyment of surfing and shopping because of slowing and loading issues
9,Tata Neu,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
9,Tata Neu,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
9,Tata Neu,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
9,Tata Neu,"Though the App integrates all Tata Brands, operational integration to meet even the current standards (and hence customer expectation) is a long way. Case in point: Big Basket allows to order upto 10 pm ist and still deliver next day morning at 6 am. It does not happen when ordering the same on Tata Neu, though it says, rather claims its powered by Big Basket. If that was the case, I, as a customer, would have seen the same service levels. Will continue to experiment and hope that the current service levels are maintained at the very least."
9,Tata Neu,My Tata Neu coins are not credited still for F& B purchased 2 days back
9,Tata Neu,No response from anyone on the chat on Tata Neu App.
9,Tata Neu,"The support is good, problem is with the the service and product. Buying experience at both Tata Neu and Croma were underwhelming. Tata Neu fails to complete payment and Croma always succeeds to show products as available until you complete the payment."
9,Tata Neu,"Iam very upset with Tata Neu, i used to earn good number of coins while using BB app. Now it has suddenly stopped stating i need to buy through Tata Neu? was there any communication???????????????? i have placed 2 orders 1632/- and 1225/- where i was supposed to earn 10% extra neu coins. I received a message that 10% additional coins would be added to my account. Now i have received a message that it was wrongly stated i will not be getting the coins !!!!!!! is this a joke?"
9,Tata Neu,"I performed the necessary transaction on BigBasket via TataNeu app for 1200+ amount. And as per the listed promo on app, I expect 10% Tata Neu coins to be credited in my account, but I got ZERO for now. And worst there's no explanation for it."
9,Tata Neu,Even after purchasing in thousands from Croma the points didnâ€™t get credited to the Tata Neu points. Have been following up with the customer service for past few weeks but NO RESPONSE. Totally frustrated.
9,Tata Neu,Remove compulsion to complete transaction with Tata pay for redeeming Tata Neu coins in case of 1mg etc.
9,Tata Neu,"My refund is stuck for 15days and counting, since I returned it. This way Tata Neu is not going far."
9,Tata Neu,"u have come out with Tata Neu without fully constructing. Profile doesn't work at all. After filling every thing, it again ask to fill in yyyy/mm/dt format which is not possible. I am surprised a company of your repute can come out with such a thing. I am disapppointed"
9,Tata Neu,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
9,Tata Neu,Poor service by Tata Neu team.
9,Tata Neu,I have not interacted with any customer service representative of Tata Neu. Looks like some issue with your system.
9,Tata Neu,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
9,Tata Neu,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
9,Tata Neu,"still neither is my account or orders shown. Against ID rajivnor@gmail.com I had made many purchases... can't your people locate the same. My Tata Neu ID is rajivnor@gmail.com, Cliq ID is same, Cliq phone number was 9739800430, remap that phone with 9035027150 and transfer orders to neu. Also some credit points of 150 rs was there"

Till date (20.04.2022) AC has not been installed and no communication regarding installation . Contacted customer service representative many times but they are not even able to tell me whether installation of AC shall be done by the representative of Croma or not. And if yes, then when it will be installed. Very P athletic conditions and against the brand name. On the site of croma(Tata Neu) the installation date was from 48-72 Hrs. Now , even I canâ€™t return the product."
9,Tata Neu,"The CS rep was not able to understand the issue. For everything, there were 2-3 minutes wait time. He was always coming back with the same information (which I already knew). At the end, I gave up and ended the chat. The issue is still unresolved - I was supposed to get New points worth 10% of my last order value (Rs. 1700), however, I ended up getting points worth only 5% that is 85 New points. Let's see of somebody cares to get back to me regarding my issue from Tata Neu."
9,Tata Neu,Concern still pending. No resolution provided. Unable to add my Tata Play account in Tata Neu.
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a misleading initiative. I purchased a product and it had multiple Order IDs.. for none I received the Neu Points.. Customer care can't help and it's useless to spend time with them.
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Customer Care Service always unable to understand customer problem...no resolution given yet...
9,Tata Neu,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
9,Tata Neu,Issue was not resolved. Just False assurances. The experience has been very painful. Regret ordering on Tata Neu App. Thanks to your poor service I have missed my interview for which I had ordered the product. Pathetic service and customer support. People lie blatantly without any knowledge of how to resolve the issue
9,Tata Neu,Very bad customer service and support. Tata Neu is Least bothered about serving the customer on time. I have been left to suffer. And worst is that Tata Neu is shamelessly inconsiderate about the inconvenience they have caused to me.
9,Tata Neu,Not have good experience with Tata Neu . Disappointing with Tata as never expected this kind of quality from Tata
9,Tata Neu,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
9,Tata Neu,"Still No response from Tata Neu. Have gone totally silent after giving FALSE assurances. No response to my email, my Twitter DMs.. NOTHING. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !"
9,Tata Neu,"I don't think I can recommend Tata Neu to anyone at this point. I just placed 2 orders through Tata Neu so far and I faced major technical issues. On top of it, your customer care executive mentioned that the servers are down since more than a day. This is very disappointing and left me with a bad experience using Tata Neu. I'm still unable to get the product I needed from Croma, even after multiple follow ups."
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Payment Service NOT WORKING Properly ....Debit Card Payment combined with NeuCoins FAILS invariably ......if payment made using Debit Card BUT NO NeuCoins included then Payment will go thru .......seems yours payment system doesn't like us to use NeuCoins ...
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu took money. Then cancelled order citing 'Technical Issues' 2 days after. Money not yet refunded. Pathetic experience
9,Tata Neu,I ll never recommend any one to shop with Tata Neu as they don't care complaint raised and leave the customer in lurch
9,Tata Neu,"The fact that Tata Neu only reached out to me after 4 chat message discussions with customer service reps and 1 call itself says a lot worse about Tata Neu CS. I also have an inkling to why this could be happening. When I first palced a replacement request no one listened..and when I asked for cancellation and refund it was immediately picked up within 12 hours. 1. You never had a replacement product. 2. You knew that this product was substandard (pack was June 2020. i,.e almost 2 yr old lying unsold in a godown in gujarat) and hence it was offered at an attractive price to clear it off. 3. Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works..Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service . Request to let it reach the head of CS. Tata Neu didnt live up to Neu. Nothing new in Neu."

9,Tata Neu,"No one contacted from Tata Neu, how can you ask to give feedback and highlight wrong statements that I had an interaction with an executive?"
9,Tata Neu,Very bad experience with Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.
9,Tata Neu,"Third Class CC service by TATA s , ths is india's No, third Class Service. Executive giving answer without knowing any thing about therir product. Not answering mail after many reminder. Solver half problem and creat another problem. you creaate mess after launching Tata Neu App. my issue is still there and you create another one."
9,Tata Neu,I am awaiting my refund for the cancellation of hotel booking at Taj palace Delhi through Tata Neu app. It is more than 10 days and I havenâ€™t yet received my refund
9,Tata Neu,Neu Coins aren't credited inspite of making payment through Tata Neu App. No resolution even after giving complaints on customer care over chat
9,Tata Neu,The request I raised is still open and I didn't get any call or message from Tata Neu on the same. Surprised to see that the feedback is being solicited without any communication on the request raised
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu and its affiliates have to really work hard on bring their return process to a level where you can really compete with the likes of Amazon. Your logistics partner Ekart is really bad when it comes to picking up a product. I placed two return requests on April 22 and they got picked yesterday. I wasted my whole weekend waiting for Ekart's executive to pick up my stuff and NO ONE turned up. This is highly disappointing. To top it off the customer service executive very calmly said it normally takes 3 working days to pick a product from data of initiation. Disappointed to the max.
9,Tata Neu,No one called or contacted me. Sad Tata Neu is tooo bad. Poorest ever service seen in my life.
9,Tata Neu,"I ll not recommend any of my near and dear to use Tata Neu as they dont have control on their Brands to resolve a issue. If customer raises an issue with Tata Neu , they can only do is raise a complaint with the concerned brand .Until unless the Brand doesnot respond , customer will not get an update and he/she will die waiting for a resolution. Pathetic service and No one cares customers as Both Tata Neu & Brands doesnot reply to emails sent,chat doesnot work lately,cannot connect to customer care due to premium numberrs of other Brands. Better i suggest not to place orders as the pain you undergo is unimaginable."
9,Tata Neu,"I never ever trust Tata Neu after my first order which i had is so sour to digest .Not even having empathy to call customer with a resolution. Only says, complaint has been escalated and will resolve.Bt its been 6 days without any update.So,how and why should i order from Tata Neu and its Brands.Just washing hands without providing a solution and ditching me in between.completely devasted with Tata Neu.."
9,Tata Neu,"I have product delivered, but installation taking 5 day's. There is no meanings you are sending product and installation after that in 5 business days. None of customer can wait for 5 day's. You need to improve your installation policy then only customer will get satisfied and will recomend the Tata Neu."
9,Tata Neu,pathetic experience with Tata Neu. i have been Big Basket for almost 6-7 months. i have never had any issues with them previously and was very happy with the service & delivery was always on time. This is the first time i ordered thru Tata Neu & was greatly disappointed & eventually had to cancel my order. i will not recommend Tata Neu to anyone
9,Tata Neu,I bought Airconditioner on Tata Neu and installation was delayed and resolution came so late.
9,Tata Neu,The way you guys are treating the IPL Tata Neu Fan Box is terrible. Would like yo talk to some senior level executive
9,Tata Neu,I had stayed in Taj Bangalore on 21 Jan 2022 and I do not see any points being added in Tata Neu. I was asked to get in touch again after 24 hours where as I had approached the rep after 4 days.
9,Tata Neu,"Even though promotion emails are disabled in the Tata Neu app, I still get promotional emails"
9,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is poorest service as I have seen. No refund amount credited after 9 days of refund initiation. When you don't know how to manage services then why you start new services. Poorest service of Croma, Tata cliq, etc."
9,Tata Neu,"Worst shopping experience I have ever had. The customer service personnel are unable to resolve the issues. 10 days after making a successful transaction, there was no order ID. Tata Neu customer service people asked me to call Croma and Croma personnel said there is no such order ID. I asked customer service personnel to escalate the issue and asked for a new order to be placed as the transaction was successful, but they said it was beyond their purview. Pathetic and most harrowing experience. You guys need to go a long long way to be in competition with such careless customer service. God bless you. I am disappointed to see my favourite brand go this way. ??"
9,Tata Neu,Never go with Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."

9,Tata Neu,"Customer support team is not knowledgeable on the Tata Neu, perhaps because this is too New(u) for them too."
9,Tata Neu,I don't remember anyone from Tata Neu calling me........
9,Tata Neu,My issue is still not solved and I havenâ€™t still got any reply on the status of my request. Purely worst experience. My issue is regarding Tata Neu coins which still have not been added to my account even after 2 weeks of my purchase from Croma store.
9,Tata Neu,"The customer care executive could not understand the issue with the payment by Tata Neu points and could not solve the same. Finally, had to pay with UPI."
9,Tata Neu,"I Buyed a product from Croma store, So just wanted to know about mine Tata Neu points but didn't got any response"
9,Tata Neu,I have not got the refund as 10 days are passed from refund initiation and after 8 days again I got mesaage of refund initiation which vulgar experience. Totally bad Tata Services. I don't recommend anyone a bit percent. Go to hell. If my refund will be provided as usual then I might be use again tata unistores and Tata Neu.
9,Tata Neu,My issue has not been resolved and Big basket only seeks an apology and doesn't even care to provide compensation due to their error making us starve for a night..I need this to be looked into as i am noway to listen as i trusted Tata Neu and placed the order and not Big basket..
9,Tata Neu,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu points were not credited. Had to manually tell them all the order IDs. I wonder if Tata Neu has any information systems. Had to chase customer care team for quite a few days for this. Concern still unresolved.
9,Tata Neu,Pathetic customer support. Ticket closed without providing any resolution. No solution updated or communicated to me. Problem still exists. I've been following up for 3 days now. Your team lacks empathy and your backend system is also not helping. I will never use Tata Neu again and make sure none of my friends use it by telling them truth about poor quality of support you guys provide.
9,Tata Neu,"My issue stands unresolved. Neu has taken away one Mother Dairy Curd ordered on 28th April. Since then, I have spoken to Tata Neu and Bigbasket help line. Both were groping in the dark. Surprised to note that the good experience at the start turned out to be a nightmare. Issue is not the Curd or Rs. 47.25; it's the lack of coordination and problem solving. The delivery boy said that the item was spoilt/ bad. So refund would be initiated. Wonder! How the new app can be botched up by some, so soon. Not in conformity with Tata experience!!!!"
9,Tata Neu,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
9,Tata Neu,"TATA Neu needs to expand the products availability. There are many products which are available on Amazon, Flipkart or even Jio but not on Tata Neu. I understand it will take a while to reach that stage but felt worth to share the feedback."
9,Tata Neu,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
9,Tata Neu,"Hi Team, I am raising the issue since 21st Apr 2022 and today is 03rd May 2022 .As of today the issue has not been resolved either by Tata Neu or your branch Big Basket where i placed the order. Its the responsibility of Tata Neu to be responsible to resolve this issue . Thanks & regards, sanjana reddy"
9,Tata Neu,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
9,Tata Neu,Bought through Tata Neu at bigbasket on promo stated that 10% neu coins would be awarded if purchase over 1200. Coins did not get credited for 72 hours post which grievance raised - neu got back stating 5% crecited in neu account and balance 5% if not credited one should get in touch with bigbasket??? How does bigbasket have ability to credit neu coins for a tata neu customer??? Why should tata neu holder chase bugbasket for 5% credit???
9,Tata Neu,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
9,Tata Neu,As Tata Neu is new therefore a lot of problems are coming in profile transferred to new profile from earlier profile on 1mg. mainly transfer of 1 mg cash to Tata Neu coins. Need to resolved quickly.
9,Tata Neu,Very poor service of Tata Neu Customer Care. Just 1 example 2 days ago I informed Customer Care that Mother Dairy Curd delivered was 4 days old when compared with the curd available on the Mother Dairy Vendors. Why Tata Neu can't deliver fresh products??? Even most of the groceries being delivered are minimum 1 month old. The above clearly shows that not only customer care but the complete team of Tata responsible for purchase of products and inventory Management is useless. Very Very Poor Show!
9,Tata Neu,Shitty service. I hasn't and wouldn't recommend Tata Neu to anyone.
9,Tata Neu,My order was supposed to be delivered by 2/may/2022. I still have not received it despite on continuous followups with customer care. I was promised by croma team my order would be delivered by 3/May/2022 and nothing happened. I received call today from Bluedart couriers and they said order will be delivered today (5/may/2022) and it still is not delivered. I was not being informed about delay in my order which is highly unsatisfactory. Had to multiple follow ups to get above info. Customer care representative was not able to provide me â€œgrievance email idâ€. Overall experience has been very bad and i wont be ordering anything from Tata Neu in future. In the age where you get groceries delivered in hours a Big brand like Tata is not able to deliver my order is simply unacceptable.
9,Tata Neu,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
9,Tata Neu,"twice i was told, I am eligible and will get cashback in 72 hrs or max 5 days. After 5 days I was told I was not eligible as per T&C. But those T&C are no where written and available to end customer. Clicking on BigBasket banner on Tata Neu did not show any terms and conditions but just took me to Big Basket. That's not fair!!!"
9,Tata Neu,"My e mail is patra_tbk@yahoo.com in AirAsia,where as in Tataneu my e mail is patra.tbk@gmail.com which needs to be corrected as patra_tbk@yahoo.com. As I booked air tickets through TATANEU-Air Asia,the benefits should be credited not withstanding variation in e mail address in AirAsia and Tata Neu."
9,Tata Neu,"1. Cashback offers that are available on Croma are not available on Tata Neu linked Croma 2. No option to purchase from another Croma account from single Tata Neu account 3. If someone wishes to avail offer twice, it is not possible"
9,Tata Neu,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish.

9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu platform is not able to deliver my booked item. It doesn't refund my money. Very poor service.
9,Tata Neu,"Hi Tata Neu,You never resolved the issue and Never your Brand Big Basket cares customers who trust a Brand like Tata..Tata Neu is responsible for my issue and it is not caring to contact it's own brand with a resolution rather than dragging issue since 18days causing distress ."
9,Tata Neu,I have been using big basket and 1mg for a long time and have bb star and diabetic care plans. Since the very start the Tata Neu is very buggy platform. Initially the payments didnâ€™t go through and I was forced to complete payment at bigbasket app. Now for several days I have been facing several issues like coins not credited to account and the resolution time is very long. Secondly the customer service is clueless they just do not understand the issue even after mailing proper order no. and transaction no. Still they are unable to resolve the issue.
9,Tata Neu,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
9,Tata Neu,"Still havenâ€™t been told as to by when I will receive the product. Every time I am told that a customer care representative will call, but havenâ€™t received any call. Tata Neu has taken almost INR 10000 for a luxury product and not delivered it on time or even given a date for delivery."
9,Tata Neu,"Very Bad service from Croma, Tata Capital,Tata Neu. In 14-20 Days Not got the refund."
9,Tata Neu,Got the prompt solution. Good work Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,Order item is not delivered even after 4 days of scheduled arrival date. No body at Tata Neu and Croma is able to solve
9,Tata Neu,My surname is incorrect in the Profile of Tata Neu App...I have asked to correct it...but it is not yet corrected.
9,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is bouquet of Tata services under 1 platfoorm. It would've been better if Tata management understand what are existing issues in existing services before actually creating this bouquet. I placed order for refrigerator which was showing next day delivery. As it didn't delivered i cancelled order next day 11pm. 2-3 call center representatives confirmed my cancelation, still despatched refrigerator after 7 days. I didn't except the order, still it was marked delivered. Now my money got stucked as the product is showing delivered. Now i have to convince your team that i have not received the product and money should be refunded. Now this will tell you there are issues in so many levels in Croma service."
9,Tata Neu,Arrogant customer care agent. Very indifferent. Plus rigid policies. Basic things which must be done through app generally need calls etc and is a waste of time. Very unfriendly UI. Cannot recommend Tata Neu to anyone in this current form. I trusted Tata brand and tried but very disappointed.
9,Tata Neu,Issue was that neu coins not awarded for Air Asia as middle name was not updated in Tata Neu profile. I find this very rigid and inflexible. And ways to find excuse to not give neu coins.
9,Tata Neu,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
9,Tata Neu,I am very happy with my experience with Tata Neu so far.
9,Tata Neu,"Superb, Awesome, Tremendous, Excellent Services i have received from Tata Neu Team."
9,Tata Neu,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
9,Tata Neu,Very Bad service from Croma Tata Capital Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,"Even after raising my issue almost 8 days back, no update from Tata Neu team on my concern. Customer service executives are clueless."
9,Tata Neu,"Provide Tata Neu coins for online payment methods like scan,rechsrge"
9,Tata Neu,"I was getting emails from Tata Neu with creating any account but the agent is asking to create an account and turn off the notifications in setting, after account is created. Worst Resolution received."
9,Tata Neu,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
9,Tata Neu,No common sense is resolving issues. No knowledge of the Tata Neu App
9,Tata Neu,Very bad apps my order is 01/05/2022 . My account to pay.2834.10. my order decline my payment is not refund in 14 day very bad Tata NeuCroma team
9,Tata Neu,"I had purchased on Split Ac on 03.05.2022 in Tata Neu Portal. As per the offer, the standard installation is Rs. 499/- plus GST. I have the screen shut with me. But your installation agency demanded Rs. 1500/- plus GST which I have raised through written complain and through the Custmer Care. Custmet Care complaint no. is 970081. Even though the AC has been delivered on 08.05.2022 still it is not installed."
9,Tata Neu,Hopeless Tata Neu should close immediately
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a cheater and fraudster team who dont care issues raised.Just throw paltry amount and wash your hands is the attitude and way of business
9,Tata Neu,Product is good but Tata Neu / Croma need to take ownership for the delivery date which they promise... Promising next day delivery and delivering after 3 days Customer care guys dont have much to do except telling what is already known to customer
9,Tata Neu,My matter is yet to be resolved. And still no communication from Tata Neu. Thanks for service
9,Tata Neu,"CC Exe are all dumb. That can't understand a simple equation. The girl and the boy kept on talking about cashback, which was not the issue at all. The issue is about 2 Digital Gift Cards which I used online & afterwards I cancelled the order. The GC balance is now showing Zero . This has be be refilled/recharged ., or refunded to Wallet of Croma/Tata Neu if has any. The amount is 5000 & 500 Rs respectively. GC No 1001340042219485. & 1001340048367920. Education UR call center agents."
9,Tata Neu,Worst app and worst service I had done booking in taj hotel through it but donâ€™t get any Tata Neu points.worst experience
9,Tata Neu,The whole team at Tata Neu has no understanding of the amalgamation of all the Tata brands into one format and app .
9,Tata Neu,"We had Ordered Stevia powder on Tata Neu. When we receive the parcel, out of the two jars one jar was broken open and the powder was all over the envelope, which I checked only upon my return to the city, on ninth May. However, that seems to be out of the return period and the customer care executives are still unable to help us in this matter."
9,Tata Neu,"My issue was not resolved. Even after putting order through Tata Neu App, i was told that order was through Bigbasket. I have downloaded BB but haven't done any transaction."
9,Tata Neu,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
9,Tata Neu,My simple concern was to Change my Name as it was incorrect and taken automatically by the app. I have no idea how an application takes false name automatically. It was very simple query that can be addressed easily by the huge firm like Tata. But I had to delete all my tata accounts for this issue. How bad can an application be. Pathetic experience. Poor support and bad experience with Tata Neu.
9,Tata Neu,"Forget friends, will not recommend Tata Neu to enemies also. Worst customer care."
9,Tata Neu,"It's my first order with tata i had thought it might good because it's brand it's totally fail & the worst experience i had ever face on E-commerce site, i had order which neither place or not properly file as complain till email. I had contacted to customer care they wasted my 1 to 2 Day's in chat only not file the complaint after that i had find somewhere to wrote email then it get resolve if i have stay depended on tata customer service i might never get my money retune... First think first customer is the priority who trust & spend online money if we didn't get the proper response it's the trust loss easily what i had face with tata i pray no one will face in future because it's hard to earn money & difficult u to understand how it matter when someone continues contact but no result come only the new chat & new customer care person contact..... Well thanks for retune I'll be never do the shopping from Tata Neu again because due to this only i had lost the other offers thanks..."
9,Tata Neu,Thank you so much Tata Neu good process and good service thank you so much Tata team. ??â¤ï¸
9,Tata Neu,"I haven't been able to login in Tata Neu App after download, I have emailed error screenshot to customercare@tataneu.com but no reply or assistance received till now."
9,Tata Neu,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
9,Tata Neu,"I have applied for a PL through Tata Neu Qik Loan for INR 1,90,000 for 36 months, on 12th May. The digital KYC system was down and I opted for physical KYC collection. No one has come to collect those documents, nor called me. I raised a ticket, numbered, 1017592, last week. I have been following up with customer service, but all I am getting are empty promises to solve this issue within 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Nothing has happened so far! Please solve this issue. I need the funds at the earliest. My son has surgery on 10th June."
9,Tata Neu,Pathetic & Horrible shopping experience with Tata Neu App
9,Tata Neu,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
9,Tata Neu,I bought from Tata Neu because I love the Tata brand but this time Croma failed to prove its services and customer service. Bad customer service.
9,Tata Neu,Very poor response from Tata Neu. No solution has been provided after multiple followup.
9,Tata Neu,My Tata Neu points got deducted yet I had to pay cash on delivery
9,Tata Neu,"I would like to inform you that I was assured that I would receive 5% nue points on my purchasing through Tata neu app. I called in month of April 2022 on customer care no of Tata Neu App (before my purchase) and was Informed regarding the same i.e. 5% neu points. But till date I have received the 5% neu points of my purchasing. Moreover, I had a talk on 13th May 2022 with Mr. Mehul and Ms. Bhawan( Supervisiors), they also assured me that I will get the points in my account ( mobile no 880067866) but till date I havenâ€™t received the 5% nue points . Kindly do the needful ."
9,Tata Neu,I've not received my Tata Neu coins for aarch transaction till now!
9,Tata Neu,"Never will recommend Tata Neu. Will not make that mistake. Its been more than 3 weeks, i havent got my Tata neu coins so far. It has been a pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Made a big mistake booking Gateway Chikmaglur through Tata Neu. Didnt get the best price and also, was not aware the price didnt include food. It didnt even cover breakfast. Tata Neu booking hid this fact from me and didnt show the price with food included. Ended up paying a huge amount for 2 days stay. And to top it, didnt even get Tata Neu coins for it."
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a terrible app. And the customer service is pathetic!
9,Tata Neu,No solution despite repeated follow ups with CS on purchases made through Tata Neu/ Big Basket & Croma. Too many bugs in the system.
9,Tata Neu,Not providing good service. Flipkart and Amazon much better than Tata Neu. Will not recommend to others.
9,Tata Neu,"My order is still not delivered. Money is deducted but no response on my order delivery from Tata Neu. Being an employee of Croma , This is my worst every shopping experience. If anyone is reading this, Please call me on 9819777107 to resolve my query"
9,Tata Neu,You guys are still havenâ€™t teething issues with fluency of app. Hope to see that everything will be good in coming days. All the best. I am happy to see Tata Neu finally here.
9,Tata Neu,"my Tata Neu points dispute not yet resolved, even after so many follow up on mail and phone."
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Coins not credited even after repeated mails & complaints over calls
9,Tata Neu,Worst experience. Never face in any e commerce site.Shame on Tata Neu
9,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu / BB have been sending messages on Neu Coins/ Neu membership etc. Incessantly. I have disabled all notifications on the app at my end, yet they continue. Please differentiate between service messages, like delivery status and promotional messages. Its very bugging to be spammed by such a respected brand"
9,Tata Neu,Ticket resolution time longer than any other e-commerce websites. How will Tata Neu compete with those!!!
9,Tata Neu,"It is a great initiative. Just need to fix some bugs and app speed issue. At support end, need to train for better response rather than just saying uninstall and install the app. Rest, I am very proud of Tata Neu App - Desh ka App,"
9,Tata Neu,A bunch of crooks and stealers. There is no way Tata Neu can survive infront of Amazon and Flipkart
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu App need a lot of improvement. Payment does NOT work well. Resolve all issues ASAP.
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Customer Service Sucks. The agentâ€™s don't have the information about the offers and about the app.
9,Tata Neu,This was my first purchase from Tata Neu as I was looking for an alternative to Amazon/ Flipkart. But I am very disappointed with the service. I never had such experience while doing any shopping on Amazon/ Flipkart in last 10-12 years. Now i will have no choice but to go back to Amazon/ Flipkart only. Thanks for the great experience.
9,Tata Neu,Tata Neu app is dead slow
9,Tata Neu,Ever since Tata Neu was introduced overall experience with all your Apps are bad. Did not expect such a half boiled App from TATA!
9,Tata Neu,"I have been waiting for response on my Tata Neu Points and its not answerable from last one month. All are saying same thing, system is being updated."
9,Tata Neu,Really very nice service provided by the customer care team. Ms Preeti has attended me very well and resolved all my doubts in very poliote manner. What i expect from Tata is the same. Maintain this. Thanks Tata Neu Team.
9,Tata Neu,"Very bad service. I had applied for a Personal Loan on 21st. April. All my paperwork are done. Even the e-mandate procedure was done and Tata Neu took 118/- from my Account, but it's been about 40 days gone. Still the LOAN amount of 1 Lakh is not disbursed ."
10,customer carr executive,Your customer carr executive was good but your system ahowed very little information to him. Upgrade access to your customer care team so that they can do more
11,payment,You have improve your service. When I want scan and pay that time it's buffer I can't able make payment. You see gpay and phone pay their are very fast you can't see any difficulty. My cunser is you people send team some ware and they scan different please they will understand what is real problem when scanning please improve your service 
11,payment,Many time email and customer care call than long time after may payment is refund 40 day around time so not happy this service 
11,payment,"Your app is not as user friendly as I would have liked it to be. I have not spoken with any customer care executives, except chat automated response systems.I am unable to navigate the site while trying to get my selected items from my cart, towards the order confirmation and payments transactions page. I have been wanting to place further orders, but I am not able to move my selected and shortlisted items from my cart to the next step of confirming my delivery address and selection of payments options "
11,payment,Why are other upi transactions not allowed with partial Neu payments? 
11,payment,No provision of make payment again after failed payment in Neo app.
11,payment,Option of COD and use or payment of neu coins should be linked.  Present no options available to use neu coins with COD for orders
11,payment,several time find problem with App and particularly payment time
11,payment,I placed my order and after successful payment...it was not delivered to me . I got the information that the item is out of stock after 5 days of placing my order. And i have yet to to receive the refund.
11,payment,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
11,payment,Tata neu app is the worst payment app ever 
11,payment,"I really had terrible experience, as the pick up store was changed without informing, plus when I visited another store the stock did not last, while it showed ready to pick up in my app and above it no one cancelled the order as promised by Croma employee.

Above it my payment is not  processed though its 15th day, and that too, I had to make a complaint for refund; should it have been suo moto, I would be more happy as this created a negative impression in my mind about Neu that in future if there is issue with order, my funds are not safe, as refunds are not done on time neither Neu team cares about informing status to customer on itself, it is the customer who has to go and beg for his refund.

I would never prefer croma or neu for any shopping.
"
11,payment,"I explained to the customer executive that I had pressed the 'Tata neucoin' button as my payment option, with only a small amount to be debited to my net banking account. Instead, the app took the entire amount from my bank account and did not redeem the neucoins at all. The customer executive could not explain what could have gone wrong and instead offered me some vague explanation. I therefore had to cancel the order. I later found out myself (by trial and error) that after selecting the neucoin option for payment, I had to press the edit option and indicate how many neucoins I wanted redeemed (the app defines the upper limit of redemption for each order) and then I paid a very small balance by net banking. Your customer exec could have explained this procedure to me (being the first time user), but she did not. "
11,payment,"Faced difficulry in making online payment. Didn't find ""Submit""  button after filling up Credit Card details.  Never faced such problem on your other two apps. of Big Basket in last 2 years.
Suggestion is to make  your online payment procedure easier on this app. too . "
11,payment,Payment process some difficult.because payment is successful or not displayed.previosly i face it issue
11,payment,"Plz update ur system,you cancelled customer order n payment give to back customers account after 18 days back"
11,payment,"Your executive was good, but overall app experience is poor, too heavy to navigate, takes time to load, gives blank screen at times during transition and payment speed is poor "
11,payment,Something wrong with the payment mode. Customer care weâ€™re not helpful at all
11,payment,"Pl refund the payment made at icici.upi from my account for Bigbasket (Bangalore) order dated 23/9/22 
Not Received refund till date and time in my account
Kindly expedite as order and deduction payment is dated 22/9/22 and 23/9/22 respectively 
"
11,payment,I have the payment for product but order is not processed 
11,payment,Only standard drafts provided. No resolution for simple issue of payment link failure 
11,payment,Offer anne ke baad site open nhi hote . Upar se site dhang se chalate nhi hai payment nhi hota sab kbuch problem hi problem hai 
11,payment,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
11,payment,"Order TC300032121947 placed on 24th aug and cancelled on same day, payment debited from credit card but its not credited again, raised complaint on email id of neu customer care, haven't received any tentative date of payment refund. Worst service "
11,payment,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily
11,payment,"I simply wanted to know if my payment has gone through. Instead of replying, I was asked about my other id. I clarified I have no other id but the question was repeated. "
11,payment,"NEU is a thrash app keeps failing/crashing all the time and the reason provided for payment failure for which I reached out was time out, however when I used it directly on the BB app it worked flawlessly. "
11,payment,"Please help me understand that how the TataNeu app deducted the TataNeu Coins instantly, and at same time get a message that order has not been confirmed since payment failed. And I had to pay again where different amount got deducted. "
11,payment,Complete help to use promotional offers and payment options was not given like use of neu points not possible with retry payment option. The chat app experience was  on slow pace. However I appreciate the executive presence. 
11,payment,"You have a pathetic platform where you want people to come and spend time placing the orders while the payments in your backend get stuck. I ended up placing 2 orders via Tata Neu where payment was deducted from my bank and order never got processed. The customer care executive hardly cared and told this is backend issue, please place a fresh order. Also, the 5%cashback which is promised on your platform does not seem to be a realty as you can check for yourselves based on the order from my account registered with the number 9916785363."
11,payment,App is not working. Not able to pay using UPI frequent payment failure 
11,payment,"There was no resolution to my query. The customer executive stated it was a technical glitch due to which my order 122371107 was showing as ""payment timeout"" despite my credit card having been debited for the said amount. I was told I would get a refund, but I would have preferred my order to have been delivered instead. The app doesn't seem to be working to satisfactory level and should not be placed in the public domain until the glitches are sorted. Very disappointed!"
11,payment,Link payment system to Tata neu across all your services. So that we pay through Tata neu only no need to go any other services websites to pay the bill. 
11,payment,"Tata neu app payment process is not proper ,this has happened two times earlier,
Particularly when we use payment by adjusting neu coins it is getting stuck and payment fails.pl look into this i could not get solution to this , ultimately i had to pay by agreeing to  cash on delivery without adjusting neu coins."
11,payment,Even after my bankdebited my account your app was showing payment as pending.That is why Icancelled the order.Still waiting for refund
11,payment,"Tata Neu has passed on the losses due to its portal glitch, over to me. This resulted in my Harrassment and TATANEU keeping my payment without delivering me the products. "
11,payment,If i have done transaction from Neu App and if it was cancelled by croma store and payment is adjusted in other way then why am not eligible for points if my amount is not returned back.
11,payment,Customer care can't do anything if the payment system doesn't work 
11,payment,Your payment system is  require improvement.
11,payment,Your payment system needs lot of improvement.. my experience on this point is very annoying and time consuming. Please  Do something about it. It's a very frustrating effort every time I try to pay online.
11,payment,Improve Tata Neu payment method with tata pay upi.
11,payment,"I was given good amount of explanation on my query.  Although, I was not very satisfied after placing the order because I received a text message from Croma asking that the payment was not completed and they provided a new link for payment (also tata new app said product not processed until 1 day after purchase). I had purchased the product using Tata Neu App and no Cost EMI option. It is confusing for the customer and might end up paying twice for the product. After the call, I am assured that the product purchase is completed and it is in shipped status. Eagerly waiting for the product to get delivered. Thank You Team."
11,payment,"Despite buying multiple products from a reputed firm like Croma, I am being harrassed with non replacement of faulty product despite upfront payment. Very bad experience. I bought from Croma because of Tata Group name!!!"
11,payment,I was struggling to get confirmation on my orders placed on Big Basket through the very slow Tata Neu App. My payments were debited & I did not get any invoice over email or app when I asked for it
11,payment,"Neu has no solution to problems. They can only provide lip service. At least 5/6 times my orders on have Neu/Cliq failed due to Neuâ€™s faulty payment gateway integration. Still no solution. I lose Neu points. I lose time, energy and money everytime. Pathetic experience. Neu should shut down."
11,payment,"The mistake I made is I utilized tatanue to pay for my order which made everything impossible. I have cancelled the order but didnt get th response at all after the cancellation or even before the cancellation. the only reason I cancelled the order is because of tatanue payment, I got scared because I didnt get any update regarding the payment. Took 4 days to give me a response or any kind of update. Total waste of time and full worry."
11,payment,You should realise that not all concerns can have 72 hrs sla. When there is something related to payment and orders are getting returned because tata Neu payment module has a problem you should have some way out. Expected better from Tatas
11,payment,My payment deducted for i phone 11 but order not placed on 16.6.22 . I complaint on same day but still i have no update n no refund . Name like tata is working like thief.
11,payment,"My 5th order was cancelled even after order successful status. I cant believe why they have created this app if no one can order. Customer service is pathetic, they are not listening to customer and saying you will get refund and place again fresh order. This is unacceptable as i have already tried 5 times with different payment mode."
11,payment,Unable to complete payment on the app for 2 weeks. Was ok today.
11,payment,Worst team to resolve queries. It takes ages to give an update and your payment platform is pathetic.
11,payment,"My Query Is not reslove yet. I Just received Part payment of 4,990 into the card remaining - 25,000 + 25,000 Used by Gift card That's Not refunded yet, Even not reflect into Old gift card, even not received in Croma Wallet."
11,payment,"My Query Is not reslove yet. I Just received Part payment of 4,990 into the card remaining - 25,000 + 25,000 Used by Gift card That's Not refunded yet, Even not reflect into Old gift card, even not received in Croma Wallet."

11,payment,"few days ago i was facing an error for payment related services and i also emailed to customer support for detailed explanation, but didn't received any answer yet ?"
11,payment,My payment not ricived and castmar cayar note saport
11,payment,This is frustrating when you approve a limit and we are getting payment failed. Worst first time experience with tata Neu Pathetic service.
11,payment,I had reached out to help centre with a query regards to BB billing. I had incorrectly put in a wrong CVV No. & hence my payment failed. i was keen to pay prior to delivery by Credit card instead of COD & wanted to clarify if that was possible by way of a new payment link . The response on the message service was slow. wait time to connect was acceptable ( within a minute ) but therefafter responses to the two & froo conversation was very slow. I felt the agent had put me on hold ( although possibly he was checking my billing) . Also my query was not suitably responded & the agent disconnected without taking my approval. I had to reach out again to another agent the 2nd agent suitably addressed my query. Recommendation : the agent should explicitly wait for a confirmation from the customer whether he has any other queries before disconnecting. Also why cant a customer make payment again by CC online if the first attempt has failed ?
11,payment,"Problem Not resolved It. I am not able to make Payment. I also pay my electric Bill but this month onward , I have to go through other payment portal because of this problem. Being a Tata Steel Employee this is unfortunate for me. I am not able to use Tata Neu."
11,payment,"As I said, there was no clear messaging on payment channel due to which your Neucoins earnings get affectedâ€¦didnâ€™t expect that from Tata brand at least .."
11,payment,"Hi Team My latest 3-4 transactions had horrible experiences. Hotel Stay Neu points took more than 45 days to reflect . Tata play app payment or recharge fails . Most of the time transaction fails . Needs better UI apps integration, customer support need to be proactive ."
11,payment,"Few things that can be added to the app B2C insurance for life , health, motor vehicles, homes, precious items On demand insurance Affordable food delivery / for aggregation service Affordable cab aggregator platform Physical books, antique collections , heritage collection etc. record players and records tata certified used gadgets tata certified used vehicles Back to the 90s corner for 90s kids Dedicated gamified experience for children below 18 years there could be many more Few OOH branding for tata pay In all stores that use upi payments Digital branding for tata pay Type of usage based rewards : Example - Used at a bookstore then a free book on next visit Usage on music store , some music related token Usage on healthy food joints - desert indulgence for free Could be many many things Subtle promotion of books, art , music through rewards"
11,payment,Refund Procedure for Cancel Orders are good but Not supplied materials against which payment has been made not clear
11,payment,my concern related to payment of 1MG order in Neo payment gateway... failed multiple times
11,payment,"App is not working ,order placed are getting automaticall y out from basket,payment not happening."
11,payment,I cannot make a re-payment still.
11,payment,"It is important to have a clear information on how to use ""Neu Coins"". Plus, UPI payment for major banks apart from ICICI should be in place soon."
11,payment,my suggestion is that all purchases and payments made using the app should be emailed to the customer. when i make utility bill payments from amazon pay i always get a receipt or confirmation of payment. this feature is missing on your app and it is necessary for record purposes. kindly implement the same. thank you and best wishes to the TATA family.
11,payment,"I had ordered a couple of clothes from Westside from TataNeu gateway, didnt receive the desired product as the stock was empty though i was ordered and processed the payment."
11,payment,1. Make available UPI payment. 2. Add Train booking facility. 2. Make search engine batter.
11,payment,"It's user interface is avarage type difficulty to bill payment and shipping, all products price is too high it's not good and there is no wallet option"
11,payment,"I did payment for phone on croma . The transaction failed and my struck for 5 to 7 days . Your policies don't let this order revive. It's a gift and i have no money now as I'm a student. Your customer care is not helping me out, said just wait. Earlier, on tata cliq , they sent me a wrong color, care executive arguing, you should keep it . Worst experience."
11,payment,You come to TATA NEU because you would like to contribute by putting TATA - Brand above everything else. Nobody answered the call but I left a message send a link to make the payment and it came after sometime and I made the payment. Congratulations to TATAs and Mr N Chandrasekaran on this great feat.
11,payment,"Remedy is acceptable but the back end team must work on preventing this glitch on every payment so that new customers (on opening the App for everyone) are not disenchanted with this glitchâ€¦ all said n done, average citizen is not comfortable when payment confirmation screen hangs indefinitely; with doubts on whether payment has been done and/ or whether payment can be reversed to CC if not doneâ€¦"
11,payment,I have ordered and payment also deducted by bank but i'm still didn't receive any update what again i do order or not
11,payment,"Im very sad my first payment unsuccessful,. That too it will take 5 to 7 working days"
11,payment,"Kindly improve payment system, payment features, refund timing, includes train booking etc."
11,payment,"Worst experience of Tata Neo, they detected the payment, transaction shows failedâ€¦ they say 5 to 7 days for refund. Amazon does it in few minutes"
11,payment,Features design for tata nue app during tata employees trials are not properly implemented. Payment features of cc registered in Tata nue should not allow to to do payment from big basket is earlier tnc are not followed to get nuecoins.
11,payment,Application of Neu Reqards Points to the Payment and your payment system is not working properly ...Fix it at earliest otherwise whole idea of Super App will Fail .....My Neu Grocery order ( BB) and for Medicines (1MG ) ..Payment Failed ( which never happened earlier ) ...and BB order got converted to COD ......and I paid Cash today ...So Fix the Problem
11,payment,I have done for the order and money was deducted and you stated payment was failed . Make a good payment gateway. I didn't refund till now. When will I get my money back i didn't order anything now. Disastrous
11,payment,The Chat function was basic non functional. When i made an order on big basket payment menu didn't come up . Extremely Pathetic App
11,payment,"Neither any of your representative talked to me nor I received any reply on my feedback and query. 2. I have lot of respect for the TATA brand and a loyal customer of its product for last 38 years. I had given feedback based on my experience in using this app. a) it seems you have integrated existing apps using APIs. During data migration you should have migrated card data also. b) while using BigBasket through Neu, it asked for my card details again and after adding the card and tapped the â€˜ continueâ€™ button, screen froze and did not respond. c)Then I came back to Home Screen by abandoning payment and went to make payment through â€˜accounts>orderâ€™ screen. Here als continue button didnâ€™t respond. d) in a number of screens back buttons are responding after three/four taps. It appears proper UAT hasnâ€™t been done. I request you to look into these deficiencies. 3. My QUERY IS: I use one mobile number for shopping and another one for banking. How can I register myself for TATA PAY. With Regards,"
11,payment,Worst service. I waited after system showed am connected and kept writing for 7-8 min and no response and finally closed the session. Later got a call and he was like ok I am from Big basket and issue is payment in tata Neu so will escalate to tata Neu team ans they will resolve - he was talking of two separate organisation and cld not even tell the SLA of resolution. And till now no one form tata Neu called ans desolated the issue. Pathetic service is all I can say.
11,payment,"I checked out my order from the tata 1mg store on tata neu. the app tells me that the payment has failed , the bank has sent me the msg that my credit card has been debited. All I have been told by customer service is that if amount has been debited it will be reversed - but the main point is that tata neu is sending me notifications that the payment has failed. I have also shared the screenshot of the debit notification received from icici bank"
11,payment,"Payment of Kerala Water Bill failed several times. Payment Gateway has to be streamlined. Then, we paid the Bill on Amazon and the payment processed in split seconds (same UPI used). Your customer rep. says to wait for 10 minutes not realising the fact that payment gateway failed"
11,payment,"took significant time to process the order, checkout and payment gateway. seems to be technical glitch in app. i tried 10 times to check-out but the time slot tab was not functioning."
11,payment,"Some features like updation of mobile number, accurate address selection using GPS, missing catalogues and products plus payment failing for bill payments. And the list goes on and on."
11,payment,"Recharge was not done,and your your team is saying 24 hrs for normal recharge transaction.What about othey payments?So I not recommended you for payments.Due to the urgency same recharge done by through Gpay,it's successfully done."
11,payment,First experience of this new payment is very worst. First payment itself failed and I need to wait for 7 days to get the amount back. Luckily I spent 500 rs . Just consider if i ordered 30000 product and payment got failed then I need to wait for 7 days to get back 30k and order it again. If again failed then again 7 days need to wait. Is this quality of application?
11,payment,"I have done my mobile bill payment on 27th March,2022 due to some issues transaction got failed but amount got deducted which not yet received to me after 12+ days. Still executive saying they are looking for it. Whenever I approach them by app's chat."
11,payment,"I understand the product will involve as time goes and I don't have any concern with the UI or how smoothly the app integrates with other apps owned by Tata but while doing payments through the app, the payment page kept loading and nothing happened. I spent at least an hour to complete my payment and still unable to do so even after taking help from customer service. Finally, I completed my payment through Bigbasket app. I really don't understand, how hard it is for a product to pull payment details from the gateway. I was so disappointed."
11,payment,"the issue was , why electricity bill was not paid when the money already debit from my debit card.... well as per tata neu, i will get refund in next 5 days.... lets see... and what about the payments.... if for the payment i have to switch to amazon as it clearly shows that tata neu app is not able to paying the bill then why i need tata neu app?"
11,payment,The time taken in chat was high. Also making my first BSNL bill payment did not earn me any benefit. So disappointed.
11,payment,My first experience of ordering medicine & payment was easier.but subsequent experience put me to jitters.money was debited but no order number or delivery date displayed.on virtual chat got the id number & payment received info.staff subsequently helped & transaction success reflected.but stil my order does not reflect my orders made today
11,payment,Add neu coins on UPI payments also and also give some reward when I refer to my friends.other wise app is good.
11,payment,My UPI payment failed frequently.. worst service
11,payment,I tried multiple time but no executive was assigned. In electronics section you will be able to see no of items bought from Croma however there was no reward coins credited to my account. In most cases I have used my credit card and made the payment.
11,payment,"Even though after 6 or 7 minutes no one is responding Im asking a query on tata neu points issue i.e, im unable to get otp from westside but i got a shocking response from chat support that better you choose tata payment I dont know whether they know it or not Very poor service and wasted my time"
11,payment,I was told to uninstall and reinstall the app. I made payment for Tata Play but canâ€™t buy anything after reinstalling. Installing/un installing or switching on/off is normal first aid if any system is malfunctioning or not working. The app needs to be smooth in all respects in the era of competition.
11,payment,Hello Sir I am unable to do my transactions by UPI mode it is not showing UPI mode option while doing transaction there is only one option showing of cards Payment mode. The UPI I'd has successfully registered and I can check my account balance also but still can't do transactions throughout UPI payment mode. I have also raised the complaint regarding this issue but still it has been not solved I has been showing pending. Please solve this issue as soon as possible or else I have to uninstall tata neu app. Thank You
11,payment,Hope my two queries solve in future 1 Torrent Power electricity Ahmedabad Gujarat state option in pay bill page 2 get email from you after transaction - paid successfully/ unsuccessful payment (Payment history purposes)
11,payment,Failed payment concern was not addressed. It was important as i received the hotel confirmation from.Taj
11,payment,After five days of UPI transaction marchent can't reserve payment no response from your customer service still saying 24 hrs 72 hrs again and again
11,payment,"1) Prepaid Recharge function not working properly. 2) Tata Pay options not found in the payment menu. Somehow this important feature is missed. 3) In Big Basket Tata Neu payment option is not working. When we choose initially Cash on Delivery. 4) Neu Points should accept the decimals. Otherwise, the bill value should get convert to next higher number for us to use Neucoins. 5) Overall introduced in a hurry, always asking for a screenshot and it is really frustrating. 6) Hope someone at the top level sees the comment and take corrective action."
11,payment,The app/website just does not work. I had 2 payment failures already. I will not recommend this to any friend.
11,payment,Pls don't need this app ...i got payment debited but still I didn't get phone main thing I'm talking with customer care he said for 7 working days ..no phone money debited again need to wait for 7 days for refund why should all these headache just becoz of this app...pls don't make customer fools..becoz you don't know that how that money come from just simply 7 days it's easy but what about customer choice that phone is important for him can't even think for customer side .. simply technical issues all those stupid stuff.why should i need to msg all for this ..just becoz tata companies _/\_ pls don't spoil true legends names...will you help me out for this transaction
11,payment,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
11,payment,"i was unable to pay for pen drive.Its sold in the mean time and out of stock.u r payment system not working smoothly ,easily."
11,payment,Ur not responding properly I lost around 5777 rs by useing ur app i Don't know weather it will be refunded or not 5000 in UPI and 777 in bil payment to mescom
11,payment,"Happy with customer support executive, resolved my issue. Got back my neucoins, awaiting payment reversal.. Unhappy with failed transaction, no info on why transaction failed, if this is going to happen again with neucoins, why would I use neu app?"
11,payment,"My first transaction is gone bezerk , I tried buying groceries but my payments are just failing it has happened twice now."
11,payment,"Never i would recommend, atleast at this initial raw stage where payment gets debited from your account but never gets reflected in the app, then u need to for a week to get back your money"
11,payment,the issue is not resolved.. I am ready to pay 449 after coupon discount but payment section now showing 749...why..pl.clarify..
11,payment,Not recommended my friends .my fist payment was filled .and refund long time
11,payment,Not able to make payment
11,payment,Please check this. The chat function was useless for the query I had. It just gives the same error message again. Contact Center was relatively better. Check why transactions are failing for bill payment and also have the feedback looked at as to what the customer should do next in case of a failure or your contact Center is going to get flooded with calls
11,payment,"Need to improve more for smooth payment like individual app i.e.bigbusket ,1 mg etc"
11,payment,extremely dissappointed.. Neu is not prepared yet..failures on multiple fronts...only bill payment worked fine...please relaunch post perfecting...we expect a lot from Tata :-)
11,payment,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
11,payment,"I trust on TATA , so I am now slightly disappointed because of my payment"
11,payment,Extremely poor experience. Had to try multiple times to make payments. Even now money has been debited but the transaction isn't reflecting in my account
11,payment,For 4th Question I choosed 5 Rating because Overall Experience is somewhat good. However Payment section is very much confusing. Mode of payment automatically becomes COD is weak point of application (as per me). Also Along with Tata Pay other options such as Gpay should be given. Eagerly waiting for Tata Pay App.
11,payment,"My payment failed because of a technical issue in Neu App, it was debited from my bank account immediately. However, I have been told to place another order pay the same amount again and wait for 7 days to get a refund. How is this fair? Refund should be either immediate or within 24 hours. Why should I wait for 7 days to get my own money back?"
11,payment,I have order in big basket for grocery. The payment has been done by debit card . But unfortunately your team is saying that the payment is failure and I have to pay again at the time of delivery. I forwarded sms message and screenshot of bank statement showing that payment was made . But they have advised me to pay this order again at the time delivery which displeased
11,payment,"There is a serious process issue. It has happened thrice to me. When is use Neu coins, the payment fails but my credit card is debited. Need to fix it before customers lose trust. Serious issue! Pls work on war footing.."
11,payment,Please improve your payment system upi payment
11,payment,Never again will I use this...even a regular bigbasket order could not be delivered in peace inspite of payment being made
11,payment,My amount is deducted but payment fail what a cheap mechanism by tata .
11,payment,"The support is good, problem is with the the service and product. Buying experience at both Tata Neu and Croma were underwhelming. Tata Neu fails to complete payment and Croma always succeeds to show products as available until you complete the payment."
11,payment,Waste service payment management once got failure it should be credited in my account but ur taking 24 hrs what's that .if after purchasing I can pay after 24 hrs it's okay for the company..???
11,payment,Please work on the payment issue
11,payment,You just made it khicdi payment app which is not user friendly and design interface is very bad. Don't make it khichdi we not aspect from TATA
11,payment,"1st Transaction with your app and i landed in trouble and now will have to payment due charges also because of your app. Also, your team does not have clue where my money is pending and when it will be refunded Despite of sharing everything they have not done anything from past 48 hours"
11,payment,The Product which will be delivered by 21st April for that i have pay Rs 1049. I am talking about payment of Rs 1029 which is deducted from the same debit card same date
11,payment,Delivery timeline at time of ordering was 19th April and post order confirmation and payment it was changed to 22nd April. Not only is this misleading the customer but also providing inaccurate information. Further the Neu pass which is highlighted in your marketing campaigns seem to be not working properly at the back end. Didnâ€™t get any instant credits for my recent purchase on the platform. Hope this feedback is actioned upon and timely resolved
11,payment,"first payment deducted from account, but not confirmed by receiver app, freecharge,thus money got blocked"
11,payment,"Please find some feedback 1. Neo app is slow 2. Please add more biller to list like insurance , credit card payment , bus booking etc Thanks"
11,payment,Very bad experience I have not received new coins for my two orders which was place through Tata new app all the agents are the feedback that I have received is that I have placed order directly through Big basket website but I am using this apps since last three months I click on grocery it took me to Big basket website and from there I have made payment so I have not open any separate account on big basket nor I have made any order directly on big basket website
11,payment,The application is not stable and payment gateway require improvement.
11,payment,Online payment is not working. No UPI payment option. App is too slow to deal with. Usually erroring out for timeout.
11,payment,"payment system is bad, page to page movement is late, after payment order cancel, Big basket control everything."
11,payment,"It's more than 27 hours since i make the payment for the recharge and till now your team have no update for me. Why I am being the test subject for your experiments? Why I am paying the cost of your Technical issue or your incapability to provide service? If you can't do the service tell me straight forward and refund my amount, no hard feelings at least in that way I won't be suffering or wasting my time and energy"
11,payment,"I had done Vodafone recharge on 15/04/2022 - 06:51 PM, My payment was also deducted from my bank account but still not done on recharge number yet, and also recharge payment not return came in my bank account.

11,payment,I used the payments feature for making a electricity bill payment and the status of the payment is not updated for the past 2 days and the only help received is to wait
11,payment,It will be premature to treat matter as resolved as yet. The payment not reaching beneficiary even after days of complaint is very unsatisfactory feature.It makes the app very unreliable. Need urgent action to rectify it.
11,payment,I faced a payment issue and your customer support executive told me itâ€™s my fault however the payment had failed at your end and the hotel then confirmed the same
11,payment,None of my concerns have been addressed. Clubbing both my accounts and I am unable to add credit card or make any payment via credit card
11,payment,My payment is stuck for 15-20 days now
11,payment,My payment is stuck for 15 days
11,payment,"i asked for telangana electricity board bill payment thru tata neu app not AP electricity board, i hope you under stand the problem, thank u"
11,payment,Need improve the user interference need to benchmark some digital payment app .i feel app is to slow
11,payment,"App UI system not good, payment done successfully but order not confirmed. Offline staff not much qualified at billing counter."
11,payment,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
11,payment,"No emi payment option at check out , apps needs so much improvement so many lags and limitations"
11,payment,"I had made full payment through net banking mode for an order from big basket. I received a torn packet of Ashirwad atta, so requested for a replacement. Got my replacement on the same day but my neu coins were deducted. Through the chat menu got to know that neu coins were used to make payment."
11,payment,My order from big basket but I face payment problem in every single order.
11,payment,Tata Neu Payment Service NOT WORKING Properly ....Debit Card Payment combined with NeuCoins FAILS invariably ......if payment made using Debit Card BUT NO NeuCoins included then Payment will go thru .......seems yours payment system doesn't like us to use NeuCoins ...
11,payment,My payment for some products was interrupted. I was sent to a chat. Told to wait 2 minutes. 10 minutes later I was sent a message that I had not responded. The problem was not resolved. But I eventually got a payment link
11,payment,Still we cannot do payment from UPI payment mode.
11,payment,"Even though all in one app is an excellent idea, viewing the cart can be simplified. Similarly payment option doesn't display UPI"
11,payment,Product not received payment done
11,payment,"Useless app, you can't change of your name, too much payment failure, I am gonna uninstall it totally waste of time, Amazon, flipkart is far better than this useless scrab"
11,payment,"TATA Neu is acting like a fraud organization. Even after successful payment, order is not confirmed due to ""so called"" technical issues and after 96 hours support team is unable to close the issue. Feeling cheated by TATA."
11,payment,Customer care executive mislead me...... There is no facility to make payment via UPI which is strong negative for the App.... Keeps throwing out of the App ....
11,payment,I still do not have status of my refund for my big basket order for my payment deduction multiple time amout of Rs.1126 and Rs.1443 has to be refunded nt tata neu ...kindly updare
11,payment,Neu Coins aren't credited inspite of making payment through Tata Neu App. No resolution even after giving complaints on customer care over chat
11,payment,They never understood my situation. I had entered wrong credit card details and transaction was declined by back. But your representative was saying transaction timed out hence failed. I wanted an option for repayment which the application did not have. Over all it waste of 1 hour.
11,payment,"My money was deducted, but the transaction has failed. I understand that you donâ€™t care about customers. You launched rather in hurry, a pathetic payment gateway"
11,payment,Worst shopping experience ever. There is no order update even after 8 days of having made the payment.
11,payment,"The app needs a lot of improvement. Introduce tata motors, air india, vistara in the app. Payment methods are still lacking. In my installed app, there are only two payments modes- netbanking and cards. There is no UPI mode for payment."
11,payment,TATA Neu App refreshes sometimes and payments page got closed which caused me to contact the customer support representative for assistance...
11,payment,Please add insurance premium payment section in Tata new app
11,payment,"I had an issue with my payment, the representative resolved the ticket without fixing the issue asking me to wait for 24 hrs. It's been days now still the is not yet fixed and I had to raise another ticket for the same."
11,payment,I had the issue of payment related. When I was made a payment of 6k then error show on screan that payment not go upto 5k .
11,payment,"Customer service needs to be more swift.Hope in the future the service would be more quick and the app becomes more smoother without any lag and no payment issues.I would like to highlight one thing - Customer care call service is pathetic , it must be improved. 4 - 5 times I placed a call, one single guy took the call every time.He spoke in a regional language-hindi.I asked him to speak in english or give to someone who knows english so I can communicate easily.He refused and disconnected the call(after 2-3 attempts).First thing i guess there is insufficient people in the call service team since all the 4-5 times the same person spoke and second thing the person attending should sound polite or atleast sound professional.More than anything ""service"" is something important, which makes the customer visit again.If its not improved, then its difficult to sustain in the competitive environment.That too being from India's PROUD ""TATA"" brand, I wish to see this platform grow thousandfold and flourish successfully! So, please work on the customer service and improve the platform's issues/glitches that is present currently. from a RATAN TATA's Fan"
11,payment,Neu coins for bill payment should be awarded
11,payment,I have mad payment and now you're saying that it's not eligible for neu coins...
11,payment,Not at all understanding and responding to customer requirements along with your worst payment option and auto selected by your portal for COD. I STRONGLY DISAGREE. REPEATEDLY YOUR PORTAL CHOOSES FOR COD AUTOMATICALLY. NO RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT TEAM REPEATEDLY. TATA NUE PORTAL TOOKS MINUTES TO LOAD ON EACH PAGE ALL AROUND CHENNAI TAMILNADU. I'M PROUD OF TATA CONCERN WORST OF CUSTOMER CARE
11,payment,Through neu i ordered grocery from big basket however the system was unable to complete the transaction. Order given in 15 min payment concerned 30 min. Representative told me to solve the problem instead of telling the order is placed on cod. The order came. The main problem is in payment through tata pay which may kindly be resolved which otherwise is a good effort to initiate.
11,payment,"The customer care executive could not understand the issue with the payment by Tata Neu points and could not solve the same. Finally, had to pay with UPI."
11,payment,The app and chat interface is really bad. I purchased a mobile and protection and even after raising complaints multiple times have not received either the invoice or any digital copying the protection . Besides 1. I canâ€™t get my invoice through the app 2. Chat agents randomly change in between and u have to explain everything again. Even after that they donâ€™t do anything to solve ur issue 3. Chat by itself is problematic. The agent asks u for an order number when u go to search the order the chat gets hidden and somehow u have to navigate to come back to chat 4. Even though it says one app for all.. every service has its own data and same info needs to be provided to each service 5. I gave an order on big basket and it had high delivery charge so I dint do payment . My order was still taken with a message that they converted my order to CoD. But worse part was when I tried to cancel the order it said I canâ€™t do it for 15 mins for god knows what reason. I let the person come and told him i donâ€™t want the order. Then the csr calls again saying agent is waiting on me. Itâ€™s so stupid the whole workflow Overall if someone can help at least the time my invoice and protection copy I will really appreciate ??
11,payment,Rep Did not know about online payment on bigbasket. My neucoins still not reflecting even though I shopped via neupass app on bigbasket. Neupass slows down actual bigbasket app. App hangs any times.
11,payment,There is lot of updates needed to be done in this app. Right now it's slow and lagging. And the upi payment needs very much time which feels irritating.
11,payment,My problem is not resolved. My first transaction in this platform was sending money to someone. I wanted to share the payment status with that particular person but failed to do so. I tried several times but with no result. Then I tried to take a screenshot of the same but was not allowed as I was informed that this App doesn't support screenshot.
11,payment,"But the app needs to be made faster and many features such as pay now for orders as available on bigbasket and Amazon r not available on tha app especially if the payment fail then one has to re order which is very irritating. If one makes search for one item in the app then the suggestion given in seating engine r not relevant There is no option for using other UPI payment which r available in Amazon, JioMart and Amazon. The app needs to be brought at par vis a vis Amazon, jii mart and infact bigbasket has all features and speed which is lacking when operated through Tata neu"
11,payment,Horrible you give offer & dont provide an option to make payment then you cancel order & increase price.
11,payment,"TATA NEU don't have many basic features like UPI payment option while ordering anything. Terms & conditions are not clearly mentioned fir neu coins. It's biggest confusing thing. App is so laggy. It takes some times more than 5-10 secs to open new page which irritates customer if we have many other smooth other alternative apps available. We are here only for the name of TATA. Don't ruin the name of TATA by making such bad product. It seems app was launched without any preparations & there is no common sense. How can you miss UPI payment option for orders, seriously?"
11,payment,Still not getting Qik EMI card options while making payment
11,payment,This app still not giving good experience and most of time payment through tata pay is failing . Sometime items removed or added missing if we moved out app and logged in again .
11,payment,"I had made a bill payment through the app but did not get any Neu Coins for it, and no one knows why or when I will get them."
11,payment,For online payment using tata neu i am not getting casback
11,payment,Not able to make payment online to purchase the iPhone and there is not same offer in offline Croma store. Ended up paying extra in Croma store rather than ordering on tataneu
11,payment,Had too much issues with the app regarding payment processing and coupons. Prices went up. Customer executives were unable and unwilling to helpz
11,payment,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
11,payment,"I cancelled the order i placed in BigBasket. Think had been a customer for years with Bigbasket, coming of TataNeu will end this i think. There is no UPI payment facility. The customer service says it is there. I quit."
11,payment,10 din ho gye mera payment rifund nhi aaya koi ush mat karna 13600 khagye he ye tata wale
11,payment,Your payment gateway is very very bad due to this my Bank account was debited due payment failure. Need improvement in payment gateway.
11,payment,I have been given a TATA Qik EMI card which has a limit of 100000 but is not showing up as a payment option when I try to shop in the Croma website through the app. I dont see a point of having a card with limit when I can use it
11,payment,Make available use of neu coins for bill payment also.
11,payment,Please make available use of Neu coins for bill payments also.
11,payment,Give tool free customer care number. Order is not delivered. Your team cancelling the order and reordering by them self. Changing delivery day by itself. 4 orders are pending. Full payment done online while ordered. Call on 7440749250 for detail.
11,payment,"many things aren't available like Wallet(money wallet for payment directly), Books special for the students etc. offers for money transfer, pay bills(please include all the types things- LPG cylinder also) similar like Amazon app facilities"
11,payment,I cancelled my VOLTAS Split Air Condition Unit for not giving the stated benefits mentioned during the order booking payment. Nor the query raised was resolved till this date.
11,payment,App not propar working my order done payment is done but not received order 5 days after complen so refunded my money but I haw product required so I haw not happy and offer my product is not show
11,payment,Very slow application. Bill payment option please increase.
11,payment,I have been using big basket and 1mg for a long time and have bb star and diabetic care plans. Since the very start the Tata Neu is very buggy platform. Initially the payments didnâ€™t go through and I was forced to complete payment at bigbasket app. Now for several days I have been facing several issues like coins not credited to account and the resolution time is very long. Secondly the customer service is clueless they just do not understand the issue even after mailing proper order no. and transaction no. Still they are unable to resolve the issue.
11,payment,"Banks for loan repayment are limited. Most of government servants have salary account in Govt banks but some govt banks are missing from your list (e.g. Bank of India). So most of the central govt employees are not able to take loan from your app and they have to go to other apps like Kreditbee, MoneyTap, MoneyView, EarlySalary, Walnut etc. etc. the list is to long."
11,payment,"Terrible first experience of placing the order. One order became COD and for next, the debited to my account and Delivery boy asking for the payment and hence I did not agree to pay and he took back. Now money not being returned. On Chat Box Customer Service is not responding too."
11,payment,Please enable payments through UPI on your App.
11,payment,I m not satisfied bcoz in my last buying 2 times my payment deduct in my Account. And it's not refund till now. Its 935 rs.
11,payment,"I use this app for first time. I was using for prepaid mobile recharge. 1. I add my upi in this app, but can't use upi for payment. 2. I add paytm bank debit card for payment but can't paid by it 3. I add Axis bank card again for payment and after trying 3 time my balance is deducted but recharge is not done. 4. I can't cancel my transaction, as per customer care executive I have to wait for 24 hrs to see whether my transaction will be successful or declined. I want to give 0 if there is option."
11,payment,Lack of knowledge on.payment options!!
11,payment,This portal need more professional touch specially payment section and Selection of Bank..
11,payment,"Provide Tata Neu coins for online payment methods like scan,rechsrge"
11,payment,It's a pretty useless reward system vis a vis the amount spent. Also my query was on payment via Neu coins which the executive told me could only be through the Neu app and not Big Basket app - which was incorrect as I was able to link my Neu wallet to my Big Basket app
11,payment,Unreliable for bill payment.
11,payment,"Worst app ever in market, not working well. It's been one month UPI payment failed and refund isn't done. Deleting this app. ?"
11,payment,"Some of the features planned are good specially consolidated bill payment, rewarding / loyalty points etc. Too early to recommend, there seems to be lot of teething issues and application performance needs to be improve ( ordering happened after 3 attempts)"
11,payment,"App is very slow,hang problem,payment failed every time,"
11,payment,Very bad apps my order is 01/05/2022 . My account to pay.2834.10. my order decline my payment is not refund in 14 day very bad Tata NeuCroma team
11,payment,"I have an issue related to payment, it is still not solved after 2 1/2 days. Transaction was successful and money got debited from my account, but the order is still not placed. Iâ€™ve been chasing support, but they give a generic reply to wait for 72 hrs or that they are working on my request with utmost importance. How difficult is it to verify my transaction details in your database and place the order or resolve my issue, if the payment is successful? Horrible service, if i knew the whole experience would be this bad, i never wouldâ€™ve ordered from tataneu again."
11,payment,CC executive was so lazy and have not proper knowledge about the app. Also she was unable to resolve my issue for my very first bill payment through TataNeu app. Still my bill is not credited to my merchant's account.
11,payment,Till now I didnâ€™t get my cancellation payment
11,payment,Please add upi payment option
11,payment,"I have been calling since past 5 days to receive a simple payment link for my booking and still have not received it, Pathetic service"
11,payment,"Please get rid of the bug, which cause things to be left unattended for six months. Plus the attitude is not very tata like. Even the head of the digital app, did not give a response which is line with the way TATA's look at customer centricity. The only person who said would take ownership was someone called Shubha Rani. Though her role in bringing an end to an issue which was pending for three months is not clear. Also when the ticket communication is sent to the customer, it really pained me to see words like customer is Irate. why would I not be irate? The neu team debited my card, but did not make the booking, did not communicate despite me raising the issue on time. There was no context given to the middle teams. I have spoken to atleast 25 people form the team and spent endless hours which I could have devoted to more productive activities, All in all TATA neu app sucks, is slow, if something goes sideways no one takes responsibility and run around like headless chickens. Or do not offer the resolution one needs. IF you are creating a payment portal, at least ensure governance, and try to help the customer. This feedback is certainly not the last you will hear from me."
11,payment,"No any talk with custmercare team, where is my order, payment already paid, complain at 15 may 2022"
11,payment,"Just giving temporary assurance and actually not resolving the complaint is not enough (my personal experience regarding CROMA), you really have to work towards improving customer care. Not to ignore that there are alot of technical problems in TATA NEU app. TATA Pay : Once it showed that UPI payment was failed...But actually bank SMS was telling transaction was successful and receiver had got that amount... Since that day I stopped using TATA PAY... Also improve the transaction receipt which was shown at end of successful UPI payment... Bcoz receiver gets confused by the current receipt. I Hope more changes and improvements will be made in future..."
11,payment,I have several times spoken and emailed you about my problem with bigbasket purchases. I have not been able to make online payment and I have spent several images of the site. But my concern has not been resolve yet.
11,payment,"Site is very slow. No offers are available. Unable to make UPI payment. I wonder, why did I chose tata neu? Not at all happy with the experience."
11,payment,"Firstly, didnt expect a Tata website NeuPass to have payment page issues. Quality is taken for granted with a Tata brand. Second, the email response suggested that the reader did not fully read my email. Third, solution provided was wishy-washy and did not specify a definite plan for resolution viz. suggestion was to cancel order and place again, when the original problem of payment was not solved!!!"
11,payment,"Your coustomer service is good , but payment disbursement process is so long.."
11,payment,payment network does not work
11,payment,It has been more than four days and even after payment being done my order is not confirmed and customer care is just there to sleep.
11,payment,First order kiya tha payment deducted ho gya Pr na hi order diya na hi payment refund friday s
11,payment,refund amount not credit refund payment reference not shared too me it is completly fake service
11,payment,My gift voucher payment not confirmed .payment awaiting topartner but not confirmed by partner
11,payment,Very bad service and app. I order thrice procudts from tataneu electronics but all three order cancelled and amount debited from my account. After entering payment otp its showing service unavailable. This is unavailable and i am still waiting for the payment. I will never ever use this app again. First of all you will not get your order and secondly you will end up paying for the thing which you will not get and then wait for reimbursement.
11,payment,"Dear Team, The product is still pending to be delivered in spite of the successful payment processed on 20th May'22."
11,payment,"Tataneu App is getting crashed, slow, and many payments related issues.."
11,payment,No one called me. Inspite of payment my order is not executed.
11,payment,There is lot of problems in the app while payment
11,payment,"My payment confirmation is still being processed though I paid it through Tata Gift voucher.Even after 3 days of ordering and 2 days of complaint,the problem remains unresolved."
11,payment,Need UPI payment option in buying gold
11,payment,It took 4 days and my query is not resolved.. Such dumb system I must say... You took money online payment and said order placed successful and on the other hand croma ppl said no such order exisist... FRAUD PEOPLE.. NEVER EXPECT SUCH FROM TATA PRODUCT
11,payment,Crap platform. Payments fail or go on hold. Shopping partner Croma did not acknowledge order due to use of gift card. One of the disgusting shopping & payment groups in India. Cheap homegrown mindset.

13,Tata Cliq,"You guys are useless, issues spanned for more than 2 months and I still dont have refund. Never ordering from Tata Cliq or Tata Neu again in my life"
13,Tata Cliq,"I requested for return of a product received through Tata Cliq, ordered on Neu app. The app accepted my return request, but I did not receive any text or email confirmation. So I initiated the chat. I was informed that refund request was noted. However, no text or email confirmation was received till I logged on to Tata Cliq website after 2-3 days. I made the request on Th we website and only then did I receive the email and text confirmation. So it is apparent that while I can make an order on Neu app, rsturm canâ€™t be done on app."

14,customer calls,Rather than your customer service you need to work on order fulfilment process. It is so outdated and downright pathetic. You do not have an exchange option. A return once raised takes years to be picked. The logistics partner reschedules a return without calling the customer and then Tata CliQ shows no professionalism in informing the customer. You play a broken record when a customer calls â€œ it takes 3 working days to pick a returnâ€. Work on these things else you will keep on loosing market share and customer base.

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.

17,Tata Neu app,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily

I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey.vikas3@tcs.com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure? What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch? What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

17,Tata Neu app,Bad that policies are changed and you could buy directly from BB and get Tata Neu points and now you must from directly Tata Neu app but is not informed that this change has happened.
17,Tata Neu app,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
17,Tata Neu app,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
17,Tata Neu app,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
17,Tata Neu app,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
17,Tata Neu app,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
17,Tata Neu app,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
17,Tata Neu app,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
17,Tata Neu app,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
17,Tata Neu app,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
17,Tata Neu app,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
17,Tata Neu app,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
17,Tata Neu app,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
17,Tata Neu app,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.

Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."
17,Tata Neu app,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
17,Tata Neu app,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
17,Tata Neu app,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
17,Tata Neu app,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
17,Tata Neu app,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
17,Tata Neu app,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
17,Tata Neu app,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."
17,Tata Neu app,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
17,Tata Neu app,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
17,Tata Neu app,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
17,Tata Neu app,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
17,Tata Neu app,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
17,Tata Neu app,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
17,Tata Neu app,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
17,Tata Neu app,Tata Neu app is dead slow
18,UPI,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
18,UPI,My UPI I'd not working 
18,UPI,I have been waiting well over a month for a number update to activate UPI registration and I am still waiting after having waited for long I have called customer service and was told that some one higher up will reachout to resolve the issue for me but till now nothing has happened effectively and I strongly believe that who ever working at Customer support is using this job as standby till they get some good job and hence the customer service is so badly performing making every  customers like me to get annoyed for choosing tata neu
18,UPI,I used Paytm UPI to pay it didnt use neucoims. Is neucoin available with only tata pay upi
18,UPI,"querries are still pending for bigbasket transaction of Atlas laundry basket, request for credit voucher Rs 200,  money transfer via UPI and even the helpline call does not list bigbasket and line transfers to other team and then diverted to bigbasket.  "
18,UPI,TATA UPI IS THE WORST
18,UPI,App is not working. Not able to pay using UPI frequent payment failure 
18,UPI,CC WAS GOOD BUT CULTS PRINCIPLES TO NOT EXTEND MY MEMEBERSHIP BECAUSE OF A PANDEMIC- AND HAVE THE FUXKING AUDACTITY TO ASK ME TO REJOIN- IS THE STUFF OF GINORMOUS STUPIDITY. F6890HK YOU CULT.
18,UPI,I am facing UPI problem
18,UPI,"It is important to have a clear information on how to use ""Neu Coins"". Plus, UPI payment for major banks apart from ICICI should be in place soon."
18,UPI,Still few bugs are there like UPI registration etc
18,UPI,"Need much improvement in applications , specially in UPI section , provide more services in the section, provide feedback section like Google . Make the app ui simple as & more languages take each an every feedback suggestions seriously to grow the empire of the Desi app proud to be Indian to use it, smooth the interface of the app , lots of buggy in it , our feedback makes you better day by day."
18,UPI,1. Make available UPI payment. 2. Add Train booking facility. 2. Make search engine batter.
18,UPI,"Very poor customer response. Also, Morning there were card and netbanking but no UPI. Now has only card options."
18,UPI,"Payment of Kerala Water Bill failed several times. Payment Gateway has to be streamlined. Then, we paid the Bill on Amazon and the payment processed in split seconds (same UPI used). Your customer rep. says to wait for 10 minutes not realising the fact that payment gateway failed"
18,UPI,The customer care executive is lacking product awareness. My query was that I am unable to find any option for recharging prepaid mobile through UPI. Only option available during checkout is debit / credit card. Her reply was The mobile recharge for prepaid is not available. We are working on that. All in all an undercooked app and an even more undercooked support team. Pathetic. So poor that even my emails and feedback were left unanswered. Very very poor from such a big company Tata
18,UPI,Poor UPI service never use again refund time for 5 to 7 days.
18,UPI,"Nothing is resolved at all. If I am mot able to use UPI, this app is worthless for me and only capture space on my phone."
18,UPI,Thanks to customer care suggestion reinstall for transection issue. UPI registration is blocked for today I can't do transection through this app for entire day.
18,UPI,"Please improve the total app,. UPI ACCESS REQUIRED URGENT"
18,UPI,Add neu coins on UPI payments also and also give some reward when I refer to my friends.other wise app is good.
18,UPI,My UPI payment failed frequently.. worst service
18,UPI,Hello Sir I am unable to do my transactions by UPI mode it is not showing UPI mode option while doing transaction there is only one option showing of cards Payment mode. The UPI I'd has successfully registered and I can check my account balance also but still can't do transactions throughout UPI payment mode. I have also raised the complaint regarding this issue but still it has been not solved I has been showing pending. Please solve this issue as soon as possible or else I have to uninstall tata neu app. Thank You
18,UPI,After five days of UPI transaction marchent can't reserve payment no response from your customer service still saying 24 hrs 72 hrs again and again
18,UPI,"my concern is I could not register UPI . I tried with your customer service , but they could not solve my problems. and it is still existing"
18,UPI,I want you to remove any bugs that are present in this initial version of the app. Because the app wasn't responding when I tried multiple times to register to UPI.
18,UPI,Lot of improvement needed for the app especially the integration with related companies. Also no UPI Option is a huge let down.
18,UPI,Ur not responding properly I lost around 5777 rs by useing ur app i Don't know weather it will be refunded or not 5000 in UPI and 777 in bil payment to mescom
18,UPI,You ask me to share a screenshot of the app. Is this Tata Digital or a joke? The app does not allow to take a screenshot on the UPI screen. Please use the app yourself first. Don't be in a hurry to close the tickets without resolving the problem.
18,UPI,Please integrate Neu UPI with SBI or major banks. This will not only help users but also help TATA Neu team.
18,UPI,Online payment is not working. No UPI payment option. App is too slow to deal with. Usually erroring out for timeout.
18,UPI,UPI registration problem not yet resolved and ticket was closed
18,UPI,UPI registration issue not yet resolved and ticket was closed as usual..
18,UPI,Still we cannot do payment from UPI payment mode.
18,UPI,"UPI registration issue not yet resolved and ticket was closed, also asking for customer service rating before the resolution."
18,UPI,"Even though all in one app is an excellent idea, viewing the cart can be simplified. Similarly payment option doesn't display UPI"
18,UPI,Customer care executive mislead me...... There is no facility to make payment via UPI which is strong negative for the App.... Keeps throwing out of the App ....
18,UPI,I could not complete my UPI registration since it failed for number of tries. I learned that this problem is not only for me and many people has this issue and your team is working on this to fix this issue. Yet to fix.
18,UPI,"Unable to set UPI pin, trying after 24 hours as technical team said, not set pin even in first attemt after 24 hours. Trying from 7th April to till now UPI pin not set."
18,UPI,"The app needs a lot of improvement. Introduce tata motors, air india, vistara in the app. Payment methods are still lacking. In my installed app, there are only two payments modes- netbanking and cards. There is no UPI mode for payment."
18,UPI,UPI registration issue not solved
18,UPI,"Fix the UPI registration issue. Add more hotels options, shopping options, flight options and many more, because middle class consumer does not book room in Taj, never buys gadgets from chroma & need cheap options for flight tickets. And at last hire knowledgeable customer care executive."
18,UPI,"The customer care executive could not understand the issue with the payment by Tata Neu points and could not solve the same. Finally, had to pay with UPI."
18,UPI,"But the app needs to be made faster and many features such as pay now for orders as available on bigbasket and Amazon r not available on tha app especially if the payment fail then one has to re order which is very irritating. If one makes search for one item in the app then the suggestion given in seating engine r not relevant There is no option for using other UPI payment which r available in Amazon, JioMart and Amazon. The app needs to be brought at par vis a vis Amazon, jii mart and infact bigbasket has all features and speed which is lacking when operated through Tata neu"
18,UPI,"I was trying to purchase Voltas Magnum 1 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (4-in-1 Convertible, Copper Condenser, 123V through debit card to get the Rs3000 cashback offer. But every time I tried it would show as failed transaction so I contacted the customer helpdesk who couldn't provide any resolution to my problem. Hence dejectedly I had to place the offer using UPI method without using the Rs3000 offer. Ultimately I lost Rs3000. If you want to give an offer to your customers make sure it works before putting it on the application. Very disappointed."
18,UPI,"TATA NEU don't have many basic features like UPI payment option while ordering anything. Terms & conditions are not clearly mentioned fir neu coins. It's biggest confusing thing. App is so laggy. It takes some times more than 5-10 secs to open new page which irritates customer if we have many other smooth other alternative apps available. We are here only for the name of TATA. Don't ruin the name of TATA by making such bad product. It seems app was launched without any preparations & there is no common sense. How can you miss UPI payment option for orders, seriously?"
18,UPI,"I am unable to add UPI to this app from long time and referred this app to my brother as well and he too have same issue from atleast a week but when I contacted support team person, he says me to wait for 24 hrs of time and then get a error screenshot and then he will escalate it to next level support teams. I feel it really disgusting. Instead of wasting that much of time, I could have used other UPI apps which I did. I have not uninstalled this app just because of one emotional reason and that reason is that its a TATA company's app. Thanks,"
18,UPI,"I cancelled the order i placed in BigBasket. Think had been a customer for years with Bigbasket, coming of TataNeu will end this i think. There is no UPI payment facility. The customer service says it is there. I quit."
18,UPI,I had complained that I am unable to deregister my UPI from Tata neu app and the issue hasn't been resolved.
18,UPI,Please enable payments through UPI on your App.
18,UPI,"Worst app ever in market, not working well. It's been one month UPI payment failed and refund isn't done. Deleting this app. ?"
18,UPI,"From the past ten days I am unable to register my UPI in tata pay, extremely bad experience, worst App."
18,UPI,"I did a UPI transaction through tata pay and Google pay simultaneously but the transaction through tata pay failed. But the amount was deducted and normally returns in 24 hrs but i got to know something about tata pay, that the job that takes 24 hrs it takes tata pay to do it in 5-7 days. Still my amount has not been credited to my account"
18,UPI,"Just giving temporary assurance and actually not resolving the complaint is not enough (my personal experience regarding CROMA), you really have to work towards improving customer care. Not to ignore that there are alot of technical problems in TATA NEU app. TATA Pay : Once it showed that UPI payment was failed...But actually bank SMS was telling transaction was successful and receiver had got that amount... Since that day I stopped using TATA PAY... Also improve the transaction receipt which was shown at end of successful UPI payment... Bcoz receiver gets confused by the current receipt. I Hope more changes and improvements will be made in future..."
18,UPI,I can't recommend now because 1) only big basket integration is properly completed. 2) need to fix performance issues 3) UPI integration is not completed in checkout 4) I'm eagerly waiting for version 3.0.0 Will recommend then.
18,UPI,"Site is very slow. No offers are available. Unable to make UPI payment. I wonder, why did I chose tata neu? Not at all happy with the experience."
18,UPI,What can your representative do when your app is unable to let me register for UPI
18,UPI,Need UPI payment option in buying gold
19,croma electronics,"I visited tata neu app to buy TV , app redirected me to croma electronics , where i selected the product and billed , but i didn't receive 5% tata neu points"
20,customer support,Pathetic customer support 
20,customer support,"I am not satisfied with customer support team, they way took 20days to resolve one issue."
20,customer support,Worst customer support didn't receive my refund yet
20,customer support,"Only neu related queries can be solved by your customer support. For product and delivery related queries, I have to go to the respective brand.

Basic coding issues are present. For e.g. the first message that was written to me during the chat was â€œHello {user.first_name}, I am {agent.first_name} .

Please do proper coding and testing before releasing such features"
20,customer support,The wrost customer support experience of my life
20,customer support,Poor policy and poor customer support 
20,customer support,Very pathetic customer support from someone like TATA digital.
20,customer support,Shittiest customer support ever
20,customer support,"My problem is resolved very fast this time, Thank you for great customer support."
20,customer support,Very poor customer support experience - seems like the support are not aware enough of the Neu app features and are only happy to send repeatedly templatized/generic replies without fully trying to understand the issue. 
20,customer support,Your customer support is pathetic they were not able to resolve the issue even after a month and I bought apple Ipad air on reliance digital after waiting for a month 
20,customer support,"I had to connect twice as the first executive just disconnected the chat after having kept me on wait for around 30 mins.. I could understand that disconnecting the chat was intentional. I was gradually getting frustrated with the delay in handling such a simple query. I had to initiate another chat and the second executive was much better and handled the discussion in much matured way. He had immediate routed the concern to his technical team. However, I am afraid to say that my concern has still not been resolved and hence the reason for my low rating. Overall, your customer support needs improvement."
20,customer support,The query is not yet solved but I had to call customer support because of glitch on neu my request was to deliver the product tomorrow as I am giving as birthday gift 
20,customer support,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"
20,customer support,Good customer support 
20,customer support,Very bad experience no answer from customer support
20,customer support,I was not allowed to explain the issue clearly and 2-3 calls and emails from the customer support team explaining what they think the issue was and the best part was no resolution except saying try JustPay which i have no clue what is it...Anyways stopped using Tata Neu unless i am forced to and using other apps which are quite smooth...Listen to the customer first rather than trying to be oversmart...
20,customer support,Worst online platform with ruthless customer support 
20,customer support,Pathetic customer support ever
20,customer support,Please improve your responsibility for customer support
20,customer support,I make 2 calls and 3 what's app chat for my own neu coin that's not fair your customer support is very slow I need compansation of extra neu coin bye
20,customer support,"a tipcal indian buys products online only if the e commerce comoany is popular or trustworthy.TATA MEANS trustworthy.know one knows CROMA.people buys product becase there a name ,TATA.do not let it down WITH DELHIVERY.There is something worng with your logistic partner ""DELHIVERY"".DO not send products through delhivery.their customer support is 0,they dont deliver on time."
20,customer support,"I was the expecting the order to be delivered on 16th  oct. On Oct 15th product went out for delivery and After 5 minutes, I got a message saying return has been initiated. I didn't initiate any  return. Contacted customer support, they clearly don't have any idea whats the reason for return"
20,customer support,"Customer support Bahut hi achha hai yaar aaplogo ka Matlab Main tata neu ke Whatsapp chat ke through Kisi bhi tata ke partner website jaise tata cliq, Croma, big basket,1mg se chat kar sakta hoon aur woh bhi 24hrs kabhi bhi. Matlab gajab ka customer support hai aaplogo ka "
20,customer support,"Your customer support team is the worst. They have closed the ticket without completing my refund and resolving the issue. Atif, Damodaran, Vijay and team are lying and not fit for their job."
20,customer support,Will never recommend this platform to anyone. The whole customer support is sham.
20,customer support, over all tata neu customer support very bad . service   i have called 9 to 12 personal  to resolve my tv installation service. i think you don't have capability to hand this kind of situation  
20,customer support,"Hello, TataNeu - Live Chat, as well as the WhatsApp Support team, are not well trained, they're just arguing with the customers, and giving excuses to avoid the Customers reaching their Manager. I am not going to tolerate this kind of behavior, customer support service so I've decided to escalate this concern to the Board of Directors of TataNeu / Tata Digital as well as to the CEO of the Tata Group."
20,customer support,"All of your processes are flawed , forat your system breaks the order in two parts on its own and hence you donot honour the cash back scheme. After mentioning this to your customer supports they open a ticket and this ticket is still open for more than 40 days without an ETA. So its not the problem with customer support guys they are helpless in front of your flawed system"
20,customer support,Worst customer support. I have not received my refund amount
20,customer support,No intention to help. Useless customer support.
20,customer support,"few days ago i was facing an error for payment related services and i also emailed to customer support for detailed explanation, but didn't received any answer yet ?"
20,customer support,"Hi Team My latest 3-4 transactions had horrible experiences. Hotel Stay Neu points took more than 45 days to reflect . Tata play app payment or recharge fails . Most of the time transaction fails . Needs better UI apps integration, customer support need to be proactive ."
20,customer support,Irresponsible communication from customer support. Provided resolution was pointless
20,customer support,Irresponsible communication from customer support. Provided resolution was pointless
20,customer support,Issue is open for more than 4 days and the call was for a follow up and the customer support executive took almost 8 to 9 mins just to inform that they are not the correct dept and cannot answer my question
20,customer support,Bad customer support
20,customer support,"It's really nice to have hassle free interaction with customer support executive, who found to be polite, eager to listen & resolve the issue raised. Thanks to all..!"
20,customer support,No resolution for my query has been answered. The ticket has been closed automatically without any resolution and response. Everytime I ask for an update you guys give me a new ticket id but no resolution is happening on any of those tickets. Totally useless customer support service this is
20,customer support,Pathetic customer support. Doesnâ€™t know anything.
20,customer support,"The person Mayur, assisted me throughout the chat conversation amazingly and I must say that he provided me excellent customer support. He was a full power house with patience. Thank you so much.â£ï¸"
20,customer support,"Firstly no one called. I only got a response thru email. The English of email is extremely poor which can not be the Tata Standard. Secondly, no satisfactory answer offered. I doubt that my point was understood by the customer support team."
20,customer support,"Happy with customer support executive, resolved my issue. Got back my neucoins, awaiting payment reversal.. Unhappy with failed transaction, no info on why transaction failed, if this is going to happen again with neucoins, why would I use neu app?"
20,customer support,Very nice customer support
20,customer support,The customer support is getting worst day by day. Please disable chat service if you cannot respond to customers over chat
20,customer support,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
20,customer support,Very poor app and very poor customer support.
20,customer support,My Tata 1mg wallet balance of Rs 2200.92 was supposed to be migrated to Tataneu account on 9th April as per wallet history but has not yet been completed despite (1) 10 days have elapsed since then and (2) my 5 previous calls to Tataneu customer support number. Learnt from Supervisor today that none of agents attending 5 different calls recorded the complaint correctly showing a bunch of incompetent staff recruited who don't listen or understand customers. What a joke and insult to Tata brand!
20,customer support,I faced a payment issue and your customer support executive told me itâ€™s my fault however the payment had failed at your end and the hotel then confirmed the same
20,customer support,Issue not resolved since more than a week. Each time a new representative replies to my mails with the set of requirements that were already provide by me to the earlier representative!! Poor customer support and not expected from a Tata product.
20,customer support,Worst customer support...they are clueless abt transactions
20,customer support,"the app is horrible in terms of response , there is no way to monitor returns and the cash balance with TATA neu is not visible . There is no customer support menu , one has to go to transaction in the mother app to log a ticket , which is ridiculous ."
20,customer support,"Very poor customer support, takes lot of time to reapond and they never know what the iasue is or how it can be resolved."
20,customer support,customer support unable to resolve the problem
20,customer support,Issue was not resolved. Just False assurances. The experience has been very painful. Regret ordering on Tata Neu App. Thanks to your poor service I have missed my interview for which I had ordered the product. Pathetic service and customer support. People lie blatantly without any knowledge of how to resolve the issue
20,customer support,A query raised is taking more than a month to be resolved.....The customer support team has been trained only to seek apology but not to resolve a concern
20,customer support,"Pathetic service, most of the time customer support agent can't understand the customer's concern and they just try to trick customer by saying we have forwarded this issue but in real they never escalate any issue to the relevant team"
20,customer support,"Everytime new support executive respond to the same issue with new timeline and excuses for technical glitches without any explanation. The replies look to be very general and without any thoughts on the problem. My first purchase experience too bad to forget, doesn't expected such services from a organisation of TATA. Technical glitches are normal for new launching but the customer support team should be proactive and provide real solutions rather than providing standard copy paste response."
20,customer support,No response from customer support
20,customer support,My Tata 1mg wallet balance of Rs 22.92 has not yet been transferred to Tatneu account as NeuCoins though Tata 1mg App shows migration done on 9th April. No resolution despite 6 calls to Tataneu customer support who keep mentioning that team is working on the issue(though sleeping will be more appropriate) and it will be resolved in 24-72 hours. I have to order my repeat prescription and requested that amount be manualy credited to my account pending resolution. Customer Support has become a joke with no access to responsible person. Shame on Tata Group including TCS in launching such a bad product.
20,customer support,Absolutely hopeless customer support. Have been calling for more than ten times now since the last five days for a return pickup. Escalated multiple times. Still no resolution in sight
20,customer support,"If you can not change profile name , inspite of writing several times and providing Aadhaar.Better donot ask for customer about their satisfaction worst care by customer support."
20,customer support,Very poor customer support
20,customer support,TATA Neu App refreshes sometimes and payments page got closed which caused me to contact the customer support representative for assistance...
20,customer support,The experience with customer support was like banging my head against a wall! Will never buy anything from Cliq again.
20,customer support,No resolution to the stated problem provided by customer support
20,customer support,"My issue is still not been solved. Tried contacting you every day almost resolve issue the only thing I've got from customer support is ""we have highlighted your issue wait for 3 days"". This message I've got 2 times. Its been 7 days since my purchase from the westside store still haven't received tata neu points."
20,customer support,"Kindly make the kyc process soon as it's delayed for more then 10 days and customer support is really fantastic they respond very quick, your back end teams really needs a learn to be fast in processing the documents"
20,customer support,It took 11 days just to listen to my doubt. Extremely poor customer support team
20,customer support,I will never use or recommend this app. Neu points still not credited and customer support is clueless.
20,customer support,"Very bad experience, it seemed i am a customer support executive, and he behaved as a customer"
20,customer support,I got a call but no response from customer support
20,customer support,No response properly. Such a 0 star customer support
20,customer support,"Big Basket tried to deliver less quantity multiple times... not getting resolution...since I was in urgent need, accepted item pack of lesser quantity after 10 days, still the issue is pending and not getting proper response from customer support... They have harassed me"
20,customer support,It has been more than a month but there is no revert from the customer support team. I have spoken to them multiple times and I get a 72 hour resolution promise everytime.
20,customer support,Pathetic customer support. Ticket closed without providing any resolution. No solution updated or communicated to me. Problem still exists. I've been following up for 3 days now. Your team lacks empathy and your backend system is also not helping. I will never use Tata Neu again and make sure none of my friends use it by telling them truth about poor quality of support you guys provide.
20,customer support,"I received a damaged piece, it took a little time for delivery and thereafter, for installation & demo - they could have been done together, replacement piece was delivered at local store but probably they were not aware and so, delivery was delayed, customer support has promptly responded to mails without answering any question / providing specific info asked for, no commitments are being given in terms of date & time. It seems no standard times are being fixed for the series of activities such that in case one exceeds it, it is highlighted & escalated to higher level, it seems no one monitors the delivery process. 10 days are passed but still the process has not been completed. Local stores conveyed that no service will be available on Sunday which is not acceptable. Despite this, delivery as well as installation & demo were delivered on Sunday"

So why did he call me i don't understand. Then he said the issue will be resolved within 72 hours. But i already knew that. The experience is pathetic and the tata neu experiment is destined to fail. The neu app user experience is bad. I made the purchase via the tata neu app for which i am to receive 5% neucoins. However the app had a glitch and did not register the purchase!

What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

23,Tata Neu app,"The representative explained it well, but not sure why offer on croma.com is not available from Tata Neu app"
23,Tata Neu app,Bad that policies are changed and you could buy directly from BB and get Tata Neu points and now you must from directly Tata Neu app but is not informed that this change has happened.
23,Tata Neu app,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
23,Tata Neu app,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
23,Tata Neu app,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
23,Tata Neu app,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
23,Tata Neu app,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
23,Tata Neu app,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
23,Tata Neu app,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
23,Tata Neu app,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
23,Tata Neu app,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
23,Tata Neu app,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
23,Tata Neu app,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
23,Tata Neu app,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
23,Tata Neu app,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.
23,Tata Neu app,I am awaiting my refund for the cancellation of hotel booking at Taj palace Delhi through Tata Neu app. It is more than 10 days and I havenâ€™t yet received my refund
23,Tata Neu app,"Even though promotion emails are disabled in the Tata Neu app, I still get promotional emails"
23,Tata Neu app,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."

23,Tata Neu app,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
23,Tata Neu app,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
23,Tata Neu app,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
23,Tata Neu app,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
23,Tata Neu app,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
23,Tata Neu app,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."

23,Tata Neu app,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
23,Tata Neu app,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
23,Tata Neu app,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
23,Tata Neu app,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
23,Tata Neu app,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
23,Tata Neu app,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
23,Tata Neu app,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
23,Tata Neu app,Tata Neu app is dead slow
24,customer support,Pathetic customer support 
24,customer support,"I am not satisfied with customer support team, they way took 20days to resolve one issue."
24,customer support,Worst customer support didn't receive my refund yet
24,customer support,"Only neu related queries can be solved by your customer support. For product and delivery related queries, I have to go to the respective brand.

Basic coding issues are present. For e.g. the first message that was written to me during the chat was â€œHello {user.first_name}, I am {agent.first_name} .

Please do proper coding and testing before releasing such features"
24,customer support,The wrost customer support experience of my life
24,customer support,Poor policy and poor customer support 
24,customer support,Very pathetic customer support from someone like TATA digital.
24,customer support,Shittiest customer support ever
24,customer support,"My problem is resolved very fast this time, Thank you for great customer support."
24,customer support,Very poor customer support experience - seems like the support are not aware enough of the Neu app features and are only happy to send repeatedly templatized/generic replies without fully trying to understand the issue. 
24,customer support,Your customer support is pathetic they were not able to resolve the issue even after a month and I bought apple Ipad air on reliance digital after waiting for a month 
24,customer support,"I had to connect twice as the first executive just disconnected the chat after having kept me on wait for around 30 mins.. I could understand that disconnecting the chat was intentional. I was gradually getting frustrated with the delay in handling such a simple query. I had to initiate another chat and the second executive was much better and handled the discussion in much matured way. He had immediate routed the concern to his technical team. However, I am afraid to say that my concern has still not been resolved and hence the reason for my low rating. Overall, your customer support needs improvement."
24,customer support,The query is not yet solved but I had to call customer support because of glitch on neu my request was to deliver the product tomorrow as I am giving as birthday gift 
24,customer support,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"
24,customer support,Good customer support 
24,customer support,Very bad experience no answer from customer support
24,customer support,I was not allowed to explain the issue clearly and 2-3 calls and emails from the customer support team explaining what they think the issue was and the best part was no resolution except saying try JustPay which i have no clue what is it...Anyways stopped using Tata Neu unless i am forced to and using other apps which are quite smooth...Listen to the customer first rather than trying to be oversmart...
24,customer support,Worst online platform with ruthless customer support 
24,customer support,Pathetic customer support ever
24,customer support,Please improve your responsibility for customer support
24,customer support,I make 2 calls and 3 what's app chat for my own neu coin that's not fair your customer support is very slow I need compansation of extra neu coin bye
24,customer support,"a tipcal indian buys products online only if the e commerce comoany is popular or trustworthy.TATA MEANS trustworthy.know one knows CROMA.people buys product becase there a name ,TATA.do not let it down WITH DELHIVERY.There is something worng with your logistic partner ""DELHIVERY"".DO not send products through delhivery.their customer support is 0,they dont deliver on time."
24,customer support,"I was the expecting the order to be delivered on 16th  oct. On Oct 15th product went out for delivery and After 5 minutes, I got a message saying return has been initiated. I didn't initiate any  return. Contacted customer support, they clearly don't have any idea whats the reason for return"
24,customer support,"Customer support Bahut hi achha hai yaar aaplogo ka Matlab Main tata neu ke Whatsapp chat ke through Kisi bhi tata ke partner website jaise tata cliq, Croma, big basket,1mg se chat kar sakta hoon aur woh bhi 24hrs kabhi bhi. Matlab gajab ka customer support hai aaplogo ka "
24,customer support,"Your customer support team is the worst. They have closed the ticket without completing my refund and resolving the issue. Atif, Damodaran, Vijay and team are lying and not fit for their job."
24,customer support,Will never recommend this platform to anyone. The whole customer support is sham.
24,customer support, over all tata neu customer support very bad . service   i have called 9 to 12 personal  to resolve my tv installation service. i think you don't have capability to hand this kind of situation  
24,customer support,"Hello, TataNeu - Live Chat, as well as the WhatsApp Support team, are not well trained, they're just arguing with the customers, and giving excuses to avoid the Customers reaching their Manager. I am not going to tolerate this kind of behavior, customer support service so I've decided to escalate this concern to the Board of Directors of TataNeu / Tata Digital as well as to the CEO of the Tata Group."
24,customer support,"All of your processes are flawed , forat your system breaks the order in two parts on its own and hence you donot honour the cash back scheme. After mentioning this to your customer supports they open a ticket and this ticket is still open for more than 40 days without an ETA. So its not the problem with customer support guys they are helpless in front of your flawed system"
24,customer support,Worst customer support. I have not received my refund amount
24,customer support,No intention to help. Useless customer support.
24,customer support,"few days ago i was facing an error for payment related services and i also emailed to customer support for detailed explanation, but didn't received any answer yet ?"
24,customer support,"Hi Team My latest 3-4 transactions had horrible experiences. Hotel Stay Neu points took more than 45 days to reflect . Tata play app payment or recharge fails . Most of the time transaction fails . Needs better UI apps integration, customer support need to be proactive ."
24,customer support,Irresponsible communication from customer support. Provided resolution was pointless
24,customer support,Irresponsible communication from customer support. Provided resolution was pointless
24,customer support,Issue is open for more than 4 days and the call was for a follow up and the customer support executive took almost 8 to 9 mins just to inform that they are not the correct dept and cannot answer my question
24,customer support,Bad customer support
24,customer support,"It's really nice to have hassle free interaction with customer support executive, who found to be polite, eager to listen & resolve the issue raised. Thanks to all..!"
24,customer support,No resolution for my query has been answered. The ticket has been closed automatically without any resolution and response. Everytime I ask for an update you guys give me a new ticket id but no resolution is happening on any of those tickets. Totally useless customer support service this is
24,customer support,Pathetic customer support. Doesnâ€™t know anything.
24,customer support,"The person Mayur, assisted me throughout the chat conversation amazingly and I must say that he provided me excellent customer support. He was a full power house with patience. Thank you so much.â£ï¸"
24,customer support,"Firstly no one called. I only got a response thru email. The English of email is extremely poor which can not be the Tata Standard. Secondly, no satisfactory answer offered. I doubt that my point was understood by the customer support team."
24,customer support,"Happy with customer support executive, resolved my issue. Got back my neucoins, awaiting payment reversal.. Unhappy with failed transaction, no info on why transaction failed, if this is going to happen again with neucoins, why would I use neu app?"
24,customer support,Very nice customer support
24,customer support,The customer support is getting worst day by day. Please disable chat service if you cannot respond to customers over chat
24,customer support,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
24,customer support,Very poor app and very poor customer support.
24,customer support,My Tata 1mg wallet balance of Rs 2200.92 was supposed to be migrated to Tataneu account on 9th April as per wallet history but has not yet been completed despite (1) 10 days have elapsed since then and (2) my 5 previous calls to Tataneu customer support number. Learnt from Supervisor today that none of agents attending 5 different calls recorded the complaint correctly showing a bunch of incompetent staff recruited who don't listen or understand customers. What a joke and insult to Tata brand!
24,customer support,I faced a payment issue and your customer support executive told me itâ€™s my fault however the payment had failed at your end and the hotel then confirmed the same
24,customer support,Issue not resolved since more than a week. Each time a new representative replies to my mails with the set of requirements that were already provide by me to the earlier representative!! Poor customer support and not expected from a Tata product.
24,customer support,Worst customer support...they are clueless abt transactions
24,customer support,"the app is horrible in terms of response , there is no way to monitor returns and the cash balance with TATA neu is not visible . There is no customer support menu , one has to go to transaction in the mother app to log a ticket , which is ridiculous ."
24,customer support,"Very poor customer support, takes lot of time to reapond and they never know what the iasue is or how it can be resolved."
24,customer support,customer support unable to resolve the problem
24,customer support,Issue was not resolved. Just False assurances. The experience has been very painful. Regret ordering on Tata Neu App. Thanks to your poor service I have missed my interview for which I had ordered the product. Pathetic service and customer support. People lie blatantly without any knowledge of how to resolve the issue
24,customer support,A query raised is taking more than a month to be resolved.....The customer support team has been trained only to seek apology but not to resolve a concern
24,customer support,"Pathetic service, most of the time customer support agent can't understand the customer's concern and they just try to trick customer by saying we have forwarded this issue but in real they never escalate any issue to the relevant team"
24,customer support,"Everytime new support executive respond to the same issue with new timeline and excuses for technical glitches without any explanation. The replies look to be very general and without any thoughts on the problem. My first purchase experience too bad to forget, doesn't expected such services from a organisation of TATA. Technical glitches are normal for new launching but the customer support team should be proactive and provide real solutions rather than providing standard copy paste response."
24,customer support,No response from customer support
24,customer support,My Tata 1mg wallet balance of Rs 22.92 has not yet been transferred to Tatneu account as NeuCoins though Tata 1mg App shows migration done on 9th April. No resolution despite 6 calls to Tataneu customer support who keep mentioning that team is working on the issue(though sleeping will be more appropriate) and it will be resolved in 24-72 hours. I have to order my repeat prescription and requested that amount be manualy credited to my account pending resolution. Customer Support has become a joke with no access to responsible person. Shame on Tata Group including TCS in launching such a bad product.
24,customer support,Absolutely hopeless customer support. Have been calling for more than ten times now since the last five days for a return pickup. Escalated multiple times. Still no resolution in sight
24,customer support,"If you can not change profile name , inspite of writing several times and providing Aadhaar.Better donot ask for customer about their satisfaction worst care by customer support."
24,customer support,Very poor customer support
24,customer support,TATA Neu App refreshes sometimes and payments page got closed which caused me to contact the customer support representative for assistance...
24,customer support,The experience with customer support was like banging my head against a wall! Will never buy anything from Cliq again.
24,customer support,No resolution to the stated problem provided by customer support
24,customer support,"My issue is still not been solved. Tried contacting you every day almost resolve issue the only thing I've got from customer support is ""we have highlighted your issue wait for 3 days"". This message I've got 2 times. Its been 7 days since my purchase from the westside store still haven't received tata neu points."
24,customer support,"Kindly make the kyc process soon as it's delayed for more then 10 days and customer support is really fantastic they respond very quick, your back end teams really needs a learn to be fast in processing the documents"
24,customer support,It took 11 days just to listen to my doubt. Extremely poor customer support team
24,customer support,I will never use or recommend this app. Neu points still not credited and customer support is clueless.
24,customer support,"Very bad experience, it seemed i am a customer support executive, and he behaved as a customer"
24,customer support,I got a call but no response from customer support
24,customer support,No response properly. Such a 0 star customer support
24,customer support,"Big Basket tried to deliver less quantity multiple times... not getting resolution...since I was in urgent need, accepted item pack of lesser quantity after 10 days, still the issue is pending and not getting proper response from customer support... They have harassed me"
24,customer support,It has been more than a month but there is no revert from the customer support team. I have spoken to them multiple times and I get a 72 hour resolution promise everytime.
24,customer support,Pathetic customer support. Ticket closed without providing any resolution. No solution updated or communicated to me. Problem still exists. I've been following up for 3 days now. Your team lacks empathy and your backend system is also not helping. I will never use Tata Neu again and make sure none of my friends use it by telling them truth about poor quality of support you guys provide.
24,customer support,"I received a damaged piece, it took a little time for delivery and thereafter, for installation & demo - they could have been done together, replacement piece was delivered at local store but probably they were not aware and so, delivery was delayed, customer support has promptly responded to mails without answering any question / providing specific info asked for, no commitments are being given in terms of date & time. It seems no standard times are being fixed for the series of activities such that in case one exceeds it, it is highlighted & escalated to higher level, it seems no one monitors the delivery process. 10 days are passed but still the process has not been completed. Local stores conveyed that no service will be available on Sunday which is not acceptable. Despite this, delivery as well as installation & demo were delivered on Sunday"
24,customer support,Please change your courier partner Blue Dart. I have still not received my ordered AC . No perfect answer at customer support.
24,customer support,The mail received from customer support shows that he never read the mail sent by me with his own ideas towards the customer
24,customer support,The customer support executive was unable to provide me the tracking details for my order
24,customer support,"i didnt receive the resolution for my request, customer support personnel gave me a wrong resolution which has not reflected later in my account"
24,customer support,Customer Care number is not Toll free. Have to search in google to fine customer care number. Itâ€™s not disclosed in the orders site. Chat feature is terrible. Canâ€™t engage customer support from the chat feature bcoz options are not limited and not at all useful. Better remove chat option.
24,customer support,"Very bad customer support. Issue was not resolved in chat, was told, I will receive a call, never received any call."
24,customer support,Amount deducted from my account and order was not placed. After raising same issue several time i am not able to get my money back even after almost a month. Query is always getting resolved without actually resolving it. Very bad customer support and will not recommend any one to use this app again.
24,customer support,"The app is in developing stage and certain hiccups unavoidable.thus i would stick to it with expecting it to be near its potential. However customer support need to be more responsive, responsible and realistic about resolving the issues."
24,customer support,"For my first ever transaction on the App, the coins werenâ€™t credited as per the promised TAT. When I raised the query with customer support, they had no clue when will the problem be solved and the TAT given by them was also not adhered to. Pathetic customer service support"
24,customer support,I have contacted the customer support 3 times but the issue were not solved
24,customer support,"Worst customer support. No intention to help. Just repeat same answer like a Bot. TataNeu can never compete Amazon,Flipkart in next 100 years also."
24,customer support,"My order has not been actually delivered but it's showing delivered, This is serious issue and customer support wasn't even trying to understand what I'm trying to say it's been 4 days now worst experience ever, I'm shifting to Jio Mart permanently"
24,customer support,"When I was talking with Customer Service Representative He correctly not given reply also ,,,too much late reply.... Next he told me to Resolve my issue i have to write âœï¸ the email to customer support team ,,,then why he is working the customer service??????? Stil my issue is pending"
24,customer support,"I had already cancelled my order, however M/s CROMA is not yet refunded my principal amount 18191 !! Moreover they have initiated EMI also forcefully deducted an another amount of 199/- as processing charges. Several times requested them to refund my full amount 18390/- (18191+199) but unfortunately I am sorry to inform you that requires action is not yet been taken by CROMA and unnecessary they are harrassing me like anything. Whenever I am contacting with them they are simply creating a new ticket against my complaint but ultimate result is ZERO. Really fed up with your customer support."
24,customer support,"Since last 2 day I , I am facing trouble to cancel my order.. there is no customer support team, cancellation of product is not available on the tata neu application."
24,customer support,"There are lot of issues at the core product design in Neu App. I tried suggesting the customer care for an improvement in future and they say 'this is how it works'. Well, I know how crappy currently it is and that's why I sent a suggestion but typically 'thats not a customer support issue' attitude."
24,customer support,"So many terms and conditions for earning 5% neu coins. When asked for those, no response from the customer support."
24,customer support,"I am really fed up with your such generic response every time / day. Since last one(1) week I am hearing from your team, that your team is working hard on my case and they will get back to me within 72 hrs. !!!! Don't know from where your 72hrs. will be completed !!! Can you specifically mention why I am not getting my deserve refund yet ?? when refund time TAT is already expired / due !!! How much more time do you want consume from me ?? Why you are holding customer's money like this way ??? I am not at all happy on your pathetic service and such pathetic customer support is beyond of my imagination from TATA like an organisation!!! I have already given enough time to you , now I want my money refund immediately. Please arrange to refund my money by today and also close my EMI account by today positively without any further excuses and avoid further mentally harrassment to your customer."
24,customer support,Defective Jabra ear phones delivered ...no replacement given but refund will be processed in 5-7 days which is poor customer support...need to improve on the turn around times
24,customer support,Only able to read whatever information is available on app. Anyone can refer the app. What is the point of customer support then. No idea about query and no resolution provided.
24,customer support,Only able to read whatever information is available on app. Anyone can refer the app. What is the point of customer support then. No idea about query and no resolution provided.
24,customer support,I am not sure why you are asking for feedback without any customer support person calling.
24,customer support,One of the worst customer support .. unable to resolve issues though asking to give feed back .. sending defective products .. Pathetic service.. donâ€™t recommend any one to buy products in this platform
24,customer support,"Had placed an order on Taj Yeshwantpur through the Qmin app for delivery between 12:00 and 12:30. It seems the hotel never received the order. I called customer support at 12:45 or so, and she redirected me to the hotel. Finally, they were able to deliver at around 2:50 pm."
25,Tata Neu,"Very bad service of Tata Neu 
No resolution "
25,Tata Neu,Sir I bought grocery from Big Basket thru Tata Neu on 28/07/22. Some item pack was vaccum leaked. 
25,Tata Neu,Very very worrest App Tata Neu and customer service 
25,Tata Neu,"The Big Basket application within Tata Neu  was a complete disappointment.  In the first try, I paid through NUE coins and cash. but the process aborted. I then had to pay cash all over again. I have now lost the NUE coin credit. 
when the delivery boy came he said he had double the order and he had brought them. I said I did not want it and he took them.away but I have not got the credit for the Neu coins."
25,Tata Neu,Simply she saying my voice is not clear.  I requested her see email sent to bigbasket and 1mg. Also informed to her when I received conformation email for update of mobile number why it is reverted.  There is no proper response simply saying my voice is not clear.  However I again sent email to Tata Neu Customer Care please see and do the needful.
25,Tata Neu,Pathetic Service from Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
25,Tata Neu,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
25,Tata Neu,Overall Tata Neu is good quality service to customers and resolving issues immediately by constantly following up the issues in resolving but in bigbasket restocking the items notifications not coming to registered email to customers whenever products going out of stock in bigbasket 
25,Tata Neu,"This is a serious gap in Tata Neu this help service as well the platform requires creative mind who can walk through different aspect of customer problems. At present ""it is I do not know or you have to check with another part in the platform'"
25,Tata Neu,"Cannot expect such slow poor and delayed service from a Tata enterprise. Even the Tata Neu application has a lot of snags 
 "
25,Tata Neu,I have quit Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,Extremely disappointing....Definitely my last through Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,"More than Customer care, it's the basic order processing & delivery issue, poor reflection of the status in your Tata Neu app. is the fundamental problem, Customer care can not handle the basic issues with order fulfillment & delivery."
25,Tata Neu,"I think, the customer care executive was really trying, but just saying I understand your problem, I am sorry for it a hundred times, doesn't help. They need to know how to solve the problems.I think the systems are not smooth as before. It took me a whole morning to order something through Tata Neu that would have taken me 5 -10  minutes max on any other platform"
25,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is a great app but it will become superapp when it runs superfast speed. I am telling that because the app does not run smoothly.  
In electronics section, sometimes it runs good not very good but sometimes not. Sometimes entrie app goes on slow mode. I have been feeling laggy experience on Tata Neu. To compete with e-commerce giant , Tata nue will have to be smooth, lag free. 

My review on invoice :- I have not found any option in ordered section of the app where I can download my invoice of my product. The invoice which I gave got from Tata Neu is not in any downloadable format eg:- PDF or word etc. So I hope, In the next update  
I can see invoice features and lag free experience.
    ""Tata Neu the app for every Indian.""
     ""Tataâ™¥ï¸the brand of every Indian.""
                   Thank you!
               
"
25,Tata Neu,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
25,Tata Neu,Thanks to all the customer care executives for prompt support each time. Heartily thanks to Grievance officer Tata Neu. Wishes all the very best to wonderful team of Croma. Keep it up. 
25,Tata Neu,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"
25,Tata Neu,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
25,Tata Neu,I chased for my refund for more than 2 months and I gave up. I am no more interested in pursuing for my refund. Very very disappointed with Tata Neu.
25,Tata Neu,I keep facing issues with the Tata Neu App. It gets issues every time I use it 
25,Tata Neu,"Thank you for quick resolution of my issue. But I think integration between other tata apps and tata neu needs improvement. Sometimes big basket, tata play or 1mg doesn't open from Tata Neu though these work properly from individual apps. "
25,Tata Neu,Trust Broken by Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,I was not allowed to explain the issue clearly and 2-3 calls and emails from the customer support team explaining what they think the issue was and the best part was no resolution except saying try JustPay which i have no clue what is it...Anyways stopped using Tata Neu unless i am forced to and using other apps which are quite smooth...Listen to the customer first rather than trying to be oversmart...
25,Tata Neu,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily
25,Tata Neu,"Cromartie executive didn't know the details of Tata Neu app,how customers would benefit from the app."
25,Tata Neu,"Due to error in spelling of name ( your side) in my profile, could not book flight and lost out on Neucoins. This was my first attempt at using Tata Neu and hence discovered error now only. Had to book flights thru MMT"
25,Tata Neu,"Freecharge is accepted in Big basket, why not on Tata Neu? "
25,Tata Neu,"The worst shopping and customer care experience ever! Never shopping from Tata Neu again. Just to get an update on my order, it took more than 72 hours. Plus my order did not even get delivered. My refund has not been initiated. The customer care executive I spoke to first did not even understand the issue and says things like because a sale is ongoing on Westside products they couldn't handle my order. If an order cannot be handled by such a big brand it's better to shut it down for good. Never shopping from you and I am going to spread the word among my friends and family as well."
25,Tata Neu,worst service ever experienced with any Tata org... have to improve lot with Tata Neu else dont know where this land...ridiculous in one word
25,Tata Neu,"You have a pathetic platform where you want people to come and spend time placing the orders while the payments in your backend get stuck. I ended up placing 2 orders via Tata Neu where payment was deducted from my bank and order never got processed. The customer care executive hardly cared and told this is backend issue, please place a fresh order. Also, the 5%cashback which is promised on your platform does not seem to be a realty as you can check for yourselves based on the order from my account registered with the number 9916785363."
25,Tata Neu,Even to take back a defective product it took several days by your team and I was only receiving emails after emails but no action. Now there is no noise about refund of my money. Tata Neu is a colossal failure I believe and would strongly advise my acquaintances to avoid using it for online purchase and prefer Amazon and Flipkart for their outstanding services. 
25,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu has passed on the losses due to its portal glitch, over to me. This resulted in my Harrassment and TATANEU keeping my payment without delivering me the products. "
25,Tata Neu,"Software part of Tata Neu has many Glitches, to be addressed at earliest"
25,Tata Neu,Same repeated issues and customer care representative have no adequate knowledge about the issues and Tata Neu overall app. The App has lots of bugs and there is no efforts either to understand or solve the issues. Very pathetic app   
25,Tata Neu,"Pathetic pathetic pathetic pathetic service by Tata Neu. My order was delivered on Wednesday and till Saturday Installation has not happened. I need compensation of Rs 5,000 for delay in installation. I have not received installation SMS also till today. Whereas other online company as well as Croma is also providing installation of electronic product in 24 hours. "
25,Tata Neu,It is a good system for material supply from warehouse with minimum staff and without physical opening the stores whereby Tata Neu can offer larger discounts. But today after receiving my order I found that in some of the items MRP was charged vide order no. TN-1079755674-20221027. Please also add more varieties of tea and other things. 
25,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu app is slow in my phone. Otherwise, I just have positive feedback."
25,Tata Neu,Thank you so much Deepak & Tata Neu team 
25,Tata Neu,"As, of now. No
My concern was 250 NeuCoins.
As I discussed with excutive, I will be eligible if purchased thorough Tata Neu before 21st.
I hope I will earn."
25,Tata Neu,"Hi Tata Neu Team

Thanks Nikhil Asopa for addressing my concern and resolving it up to expectation. Thouth it was resolved, the process of getting support was not easy, many people were involved in communication which was quite time consuming and frustrating, resolution process might be quite simpler.

BR
Prakash"
25,Tata Neu,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address..!!?? Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good."
25,Tata Neu,Make Tata Neu app faster. It lags way too much to be usable.
25,Tata Neu,Useless. Never shop again on Tata Neu 
25,Tata Neu,Your Tata Neu is hopeless.They could not solve my problem .Finally Bigbasket daily executive advised to update the app through play store.I did it and problem is over.
25,Tata Neu,Improve Tata Neu payment method with tata pay upi.
25,Tata Neu,"I was given good amount of explanation on my query.  Although, I was not very satisfied after placing the order because I received a text message from Croma asking that the payment was not completed and they provided a new link for payment (also tata new app said product not processed until 1 day after purchase). I had purchased the product using Tata Neu App and no Cost EMI option. It is confusing for the customer and might end up paying twice for the product. After the call, I am assured that the product purchase is completed and it is in shipped status. Eagerly waiting for the product to get delivered. Thank You Team."
25,Tata Neu,"I am really sad to learn the pathetic service from Tata Neu whether its customer care executive or your delivery partner. If you cannot provide me the service than why the hell you take the order and money. You have my address and every other detail , and you should first ascertain the fact first. I need the mobile on very urgent basis but because of your poor and degraded service i am unable to get it now and more so my money is also blocked which i cant use to purchase from some where else. Thanks and regards. My only advise would be to improve your self  bcoz this sought of harassments would really affect the reputation of your brand Tata Neu"
25,Tata Neu,"I tried to explain to each agent that I had not cancelled the Croma Order after paying the total amount by Credit Card and that there was a fraud being committed at either Croma or in the NeuCoins department of Tata Neu, but nobody has taken it seriously. I have bee defrauded of 120 - 6 = 114 New Coins"
25,Tata Neu,I was struggling to get confirmation on my orders placed on Big Basket through the very slow Tata Neu App. My payments were debited & I did not get any invoice over email or app when I asked for it
25,Tata Neu,Purchases at Westside stores not getting integrated in Tata Neu. Call Centre has no visibility to this and ask for physical receipts.
25,Tata Neu,It took them over 2 weeks just to inform me that a Covid RT-PCR test through Tata 1mg app does not contribute towards Tata Neu Coins. Expect better from such a reputed company.
25,Tata Neu,"You guys are useless, issues spanned for more than 2 months and I still dont have refund. Never ordering from Tata Cliq or Tata Neu again in my life"
25,Tata Neu,I had placed my query on 18th June. Itâ€™s already 24th June now. They are still stalling my issue and not giving any resolve. Pathetic customer service and pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Worst platform to buy anything.
25,Tata Neu,"I was told to share the screenshot of the problem I had raised. Am email was supposed to be send by Tata Neu, in which I had to share the screenshot. However, I didn't receive any email or link."
25,Tata Neu,"However, the bills paid in the Taj Hotels bars after discounts during happy hours do not qualify for Tata Neu points. This must be rectified."
25,Tata Neu,"I had a worst experience with Tata Neu. First purchase and you lost me as a customer and I ever interact with anyone. I won't purchase a thing from here. Never going to suggest to purchase. Customer support not one multiple worthless. Knowledge less. They are supposed to know that discount price and no cost emi upfront waiver is from merchant itself not bank. Even after making them understand they routed me to bank. I'm waiting for a reply from Neu otherwise you soon be getting a legal notice from consumer court, filed by mem worst place to purchase. Never visting again"
25,Tata Neu,Unable to use NEU coins on big basket and now coins will expire without me availing benefit called both Big Basket and Tata Neu but issue not yet resolved
25,Tata Neu,"Problem Not resolved It. I am not able to make Payment. I also pay my electric Bill but this month onward , I have to go through other payment portal because of this problem. Being a Tata Steel Employee this is unfortunate for me. I am not able to use Tata Neu."
25,Tata Neu,"The issue was not all resolved, till date. Requesting the Tata Neu Team to kindly resolve the issue and refund the cancellation amount of Rs.262 to Credit card and 37 Neu Coins."
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu app is a good initiative & offers great benifits to customer. Moreover it is very user friendly.
25,Tata Neu,Wishing the entire Tata Neu team all the very best. May you beat Amazon (also Reliance- the unreliable) and rule India with the maximum market share. Best wishes from a Tata loyalist and shareholder!
25,Tata Neu,Sorry to say no one has called me nor have replied to my query. Contacting and communication was easy with Taj Inner Circle group earlier. Tata Neu app is horrible and cannot resolve or refer to specific questions .

25,Tata Neu,Bad that policies are changed and you could buy directly from BB and get Tata Neu points and now you must from directly Tata Neu app but is not informed that this change has happened.
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu and Tata Pay require lot of attention. Payment got stuck multiple time. APP gets hang in between
25,Tata Neu,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
25,Tata Neu,No proper response. Website not friendly. Tata Neu only wants to Apply for loans and not provide EMI Card.
25,Tata Neu,"Hi, This Is Vardhan Varma Penmetsa. I just Interact With Tata Neu Customer Care Service And The Person From Tata Neu Care End Was Responded Promptly And Sort Out My Issues. Thanks A Lot To Customer Care Executive Woo Responded Immediately And Solve The Issues And Wishing All Success To Team Tata Neu. Thank You So Much ? ?"
25,Tata Neu,"The Response is simply awesome, Thank You So Much And Wishing You All Success To Team Tata Neu.??"
25,Tata Neu,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
25,Tata Neu,Need to more quick respond in Tata Neu because its taking so much time.
25,Tata Neu,Really nice support is provided by Tata Neu support team.
25,Tata Neu,Dear Tata Neu welcome to new digital services We always with you We will remember your social services
25,Tata Neu,very bad experience...i am not getting my Tata Neu Coins... already raised complaint but no solution... only saying we are working on it.it had been 1 week...
25,Tata Neu,excellent. anyhow my problem is not resolved yet. My Tata 1mg cash could not be carried forwarded to Tata Neu Coin yet. Hope let me wait for some more days to to resolve this
25,Tata Neu,Worst experience with Tata Neu ordering. It took 1 hour on chat to make him understand the issue. It would have been better to talk instead of chat for an hour.
25,Tata Neu,"Grocery part is not accessible, app gets hanged in the case of clicking Grocery. For some other items also App gets hanged. Secondly I am having 2 Accounts of Tata 1 mg and I have been operating the one with Mobile No. 9981491770. (Email id daudchoudhary@gmail.com. I want this account be merged with Tata Neu App with Mobile No. 9424442773 (email id -daudchoudhary@yahoo.com), but somehow it is not getting done. Earlier also I requested to chnage my mobile no. From 9981491770 to 9424442773, but I was informed it is not possible. If it isnot possible, atleast transfer all my Orders and Prescriptions to the Account with Mobile No.9424442773, for records."
25,Tata Neu,"At least there should be a way to resolve the issue than letting the customer to figure out what should be done. The call as well as the email response was below expectations. My belief that Tata would be ae to take on Amazon lies in vain, I dont think from my experience. Even Flipkart fares below Amazon in meeting customer expectations. Tata Neu has failed to impress me, franky speaking."
25,Tata Neu,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu coins not received even after raising ticket twice. Please resolve Ticket #720576 asap.
25,Tata Neu,No solution with your representatives. Even they don't know about Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,I am not satisfied because I have made a big purchase only few weeks before launch of Tata Neu and I am not getting any Neu coins for that purchase. I am not likely to make such a big purchase again in the next 3-4 years so I feel I have missed out on the benefit of Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
25,Tata Neu,"1) Prepaid Recharge function not working properly. 2) Tata Pay options not found in the payment menu. Somehow this important feature is missed. 3) In Big Basket Tata Neu payment option is not working. When we choose initially Cash on Delivery. 4) Neu Points should accept the decimals. Otherwise, the bill value should get convert to next higher number for us to use Neucoins. 5) Overall introduced in a hurry, always asking for a screenshot and it is really frustrating. 6) Hope someone at the top level sees the comment and take corrective action."
25,Tata Neu,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
25,Tata Neu,I HAVE BEEN USING TATANEU FROM PAST 4 TO 5 MONTHS..Tata Neu is getting stuck/Hanged a lot ...it taking time to load ....please work on it .It is very beneficial app...but its affecting the enjoyment of surfing and shopping because of slowing and loading issues
25,Tata Neu,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
25,Tata Neu,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
25,Tata Neu,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
25,Tata Neu,"Though the App integrates all Tata Brands, operational integration to meet even the current standards (and hence customer expectation) is a long way. Case in point: Big Basket allows to order upto 10 pm ist and still deliver next day morning at 6 am. It does not happen when ordering the same on Tata Neu, though it says, rather claims its powered by Big Basket. If that was the case, I, as a customer, would have seen the same service levels. Will continue to experiment and hope that the current service levels are maintained at the very least."
25,Tata Neu,My Tata Neu coins are not credited still for F& B purchased 2 days back
25,Tata Neu,No response from anyone on the chat on Tata Neu App.
25,Tata Neu,"The support is good, problem is with the the service and product. Buying experience at both Tata Neu and Croma were underwhelming. Tata Neu fails to complete payment and Croma always succeeds to show products as available until you complete the payment."
25,Tata Neu,"Iam very upset with Tata Neu, i used to earn good number of coins while using BB app. Now it has suddenly stopped stating i need to buy through Tata Neu? was there any communication???????????????? i have placed 2 orders 1632/- and 1225/- where i was supposed to earn 10% extra neu coins. I received a message that 10% additional coins would be added to my account. Now i have received a message that it was wrongly stated i will not be getting the coins !!!!!!! is this a joke?"
25,Tata Neu,"I performed the necessary transaction on BigBasket via TataNeu app for 1200+ amount. And as per the listed promo on app, I expect 10% Tata Neu coins to be credited in my account, but I got ZERO for now. And worst there's no explanation for it."
25,Tata Neu,Even after purchasing in thousands from Croma the points didnâ€™t get credited to the Tata Neu points. Have been following up with the customer service for past few weeks but NO RESPONSE. Totally frustrated.
25,Tata Neu,Remove compulsion to complete transaction with Tata pay for redeeming Tata Neu coins in case of 1mg etc.
25,Tata Neu,"My refund is stuck for 15days and counting, since I returned it. This way Tata Neu is not going far."
25,Tata Neu,"u have come out with Tata Neu without fully constructing. Profile doesn't work at all. After filling every thing, it again ask to fill in yyyy/mm/dt format which is not possible. I am surprised a company of your repute can come out with such a thing. I am disapppointed"
25,Tata Neu,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
25,Tata Neu,Poor service by Tata Neu team.
25,Tata Neu,I have not interacted with any customer service representative of Tata Neu. Looks like some issue with your system.
25,Tata Neu,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
25,Tata Neu,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
25,Tata Neu,"still neither is my account or orders shown. Against ID rajivnor@gmail.com I had made many purchases... can't your people locate the same. My Tata Neu ID is rajivnor@gmail.com, Cliq ID is same, Cliq phone number was 9739800430, remap that phone with 9035027150 and transfer orders to neu. Also some credit points of 150 rs was there"
25,Tata Neu,"Online Order was placed on 12.04.2022on Tata Neu .Material delivered on 15.04.2022 however the date of delivery was upto 14.04.2022. Till date (20.04.2022) AC has not been installed and no communication regarding installation . Contacted customer service representative many times but they are not even able to tell me whether installation of AC shall be done by the representative of Croma or not. And if yes, then when it will be installed. Very P athletic conditions and against the brand name. On the site of croma(Tata Neu) the installation date was from 48-72 Hrs. Now , even I canâ€™t return the product."
25,Tata Neu,"The CS rep was not able to understand the issue. For everything, there were 2-3 minutes wait time. He was always coming back with the same information (which I already knew). At the end, I gave up and ended the chat. The issue is still unresolved - I was supposed to get New points worth 10% of my last order value (Rs. 1700), however, I ended up getting points worth only 5% that is 85 New points. Let's see of somebody cares to get back to me regarding my issue from Tata Neu."
25,Tata Neu,Concern still pending. No resolution provided. Unable to add my Tata Play account in Tata Neu.
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a misleading initiative. I purchased a product and it had multiple Order IDs.. for none I received the Neu Points.. Customer care can't help and it's useless to spend time with them.
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Customer Care Service always unable to understand customer problem...no resolution given yet...
25,Tata Neu,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
25,Tata Neu,Issue was not resolved. Just False assurances. The experience has been very painful. Regret ordering on Tata Neu App. Thanks to your poor service I have missed my interview for which I had ordered the product. Pathetic service and customer support. People lie blatantly without any knowledge of how to resolve the issue
25,Tata Neu,Very bad customer service and support. Tata Neu is Least bothered about serving the customer on time. I have been left to suffer. And worst is that Tata Neu is shamelessly inconsiderate about the inconvenience they have caused to me.
25,Tata Neu,Not have good experience with Tata Neu . Disappointing with Tata as never expected this kind of quality from Tata
25,Tata Neu,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
25,Tata Neu,"Still No response from Tata Neu. Have gone totally silent after giving FALSE assurances. No response to my email, my Twitter DMs.. NOTHING. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !"
25,Tata Neu,"I don't think I can recommend Tata Neu to anyone at this point. I just placed 2 orders through Tata Neu so far and I faced major technical issues. On top of it, your customer care executive mentioned that the servers are down since more than a day. This is very disappointing and left me with a bad experience using Tata Neu. I'm still unable to get the product I needed from Croma, even after multiple follow ups."
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Payment Service NOT WORKING Properly ....Debit Card Payment combined with NeuCoins FAILS invariably ......if payment made using Debit Card BUT NO NeuCoins included then Payment will go thru .......seems yours payment system doesn't like us to use NeuCoins ...
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu took money. Then cancelled order citing 'Technical Issues' 2 days after. Money not yet refunded. Pathetic experience
25,Tata Neu,I ll never recommend any one to shop with Tata Neu as they don't care complaint raised and leave the customer in lurch
25,Tata Neu,"The fact that Tata Neu only reached out to me after 4 chat message discussions with customer service reps and 1 call itself says a lot worse about Tata Neu CS. I also have an inkling to why this could be happening. When I first palced a replacement request no one listened..and when I asked for cancellation and refund it was immediately picked up within 12 hours. 1. You never had a replacement product. 2. You knew that this product was substandard (pack was June 2020. i,.e almost 2 yr old lying unsold in a godown in gujarat) and hence it was offered at an attractive price to clear it off. 3. Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works..Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service . Request to let it reach the head of CS. Tata Neu didnt live up to Neu. Nothing new in Neu."

25,Tata Neu,"No one contacted from Tata Neu, how can you ask to give feedback and highlight wrong statements that I had an interaction with an executive?"
25,Tata Neu,Very bad experience with Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.
25,Tata Neu,"Third Class CC service by TATA s , ths is india's No, third Class Service. Executive giving answer without knowing any thing about therir product. Not answering mail after many reminder. Solver half problem and creat another problem. you creaate mess after launching Tata Neu App. my issue is still there and you create another one."
25,Tata Neu,I am awaiting my refund for the cancellation of hotel booking at Taj palace Delhi through Tata Neu app. It is more than 10 days and I havenâ€™t yet received my refund
25,Tata Neu,Neu Coins aren't credited inspite of making payment through Tata Neu App. No resolution even after giving complaints on customer care over chat
25,Tata Neu,The request I raised is still open and I didn't get any call or message from Tata Neu on the same. Surprised to see that the feedback is being solicited without any communication on the request raised
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu and its affiliates have to really work hard on bring their return process to a level where you can really compete with the likes of Amazon. Your logistics partner Ekart is really bad when it comes to picking up a product. I placed two return requests on April 22 and they got picked yesterday. I wasted my whole weekend waiting for Ekart's executive to pick up my stuff and NO ONE turned up. This is highly disappointing. To top it off the customer service executive very calmly said it normally takes 3 working days to pick a product from data of initiation. Disappointed to the max.
25,Tata Neu,No one called or contacted me. Sad Tata Neu is tooo bad. Poorest ever service seen in my life.
25,Tata Neu,"I ll not recommend any of my near and dear to use Tata Neu as they dont have control on their Brands to resolve a issue. If customer raises an issue with Tata Neu , they can only do is raise a complaint with the concerned brand .Until unless the Brand doesnot respond , customer will not get an update and he/she will die waiting for a resolution. Pathetic service and No one cares customers as Both Tata Neu & Brands doesnot reply to emails sent,chat doesnot work lately,cannot connect to customer care due to premium numberrs of other Brands. Better i suggest not to place orders as the pain you undergo is unimaginable."
25,Tata Neu,"I never ever trust Tata Neu after my first order which i had is so sour to digest .Not even having empathy to call customer with a resolution. Only says, complaint has been escalated and will resolve.Bt its been 6 days without any update.So,how and why should i order from Tata Neu and its Brands.Just washing hands without providing a solution and ditching me in between.completely devasted with Tata Neu.."
25,Tata Neu,"I have product delivered, but installation taking 5 day's. There is no meanings you are sending product and installation after that in 5 business days. None of customer can wait for 5 day's. You need to improve your installation policy then only customer will get satisfied and will recomend the Tata Neu."
25,Tata Neu,pathetic experience with Tata Neu. i have been Big Basket for almost 6-7 months. i have never had any issues with them previously and was very happy with the service & delivery was always on time. This is the first time i ordered thru Tata Neu & was greatly disappointed & eventually had to cancel my order. i will not recommend Tata Neu to anyone
25,Tata Neu,I bought Airconditioner on Tata Neu and installation was delayed and resolution came so late.
25,Tata Neu,The way you guys are treating the IPL Tata Neu Fan Box is terrible. Would like yo talk to some senior level executive
25,Tata Neu,I had stayed in Taj Bangalore on 21 Jan 2022 and I do not see any points being added in Tata Neu. I was asked to get in touch again after 24 hours where as I had approached the rep after 4 days.
25,Tata Neu,"Even though promotion emails are disabled in the Tata Neu app, I still get promotional emails"
25,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is poorest service as I have seen. No refund amount credited after 9 days of refund initiation. When you don't know how to manage services then why you start new services. Poorest service of Croma, Tata cliq, etc."
25,Tata Neu,"Worst shopping experience I have ever had. The customer service personnel are unable to resolve the issues. 10 days after making a successful transaction, there was no order ID. Tata Neu customer service people asked me to call Croma and Croma personnel said there is no such order ID. I asked customer service personnel to escalate the issue and asked for a new order to be placed as the transaction was successful, but they said it was beyond their purview. Pathetic and most harrowing experience. You guys need to go a long long way to be in competition with such careless customer service. God bless you. I am disappointed to see my favourite brand go this way. ??"
25,Tata Neu,Never go with Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."

25,Tata Neu,"Customer support team is not knowledgeable on the Tata Neu, perhaps because this is too New(u) for them too."
25,Tata Neu,I don't remember anyone from Tata Neu calling me........
25,Tata Neu,My issue is still not solved and I havenâ€™t still got any reply on the status of my request. Purely worst experience. My issue is regarding Tata Neu coins which still have not been added to my account even after 2 weeks of my purchase from Croma store.
25,Tata Neu,"The customer care executive could not understand the issue with the payment by Tata Neu points and could not solve the same. Finally, had to pay with UPI."
25,Tata Neu,"I Buyed a product from Croma store, So just wanted to know about mine Tata Neu points but didn't got any response"
25,Tata Neu,I have not got the refund as 10 days are passed from refund initiation and after 8 days again I got mesaage of refund initiation which vulgar experience. Totally bad Tata Services. I don't recommend anyone a bit percent. Go to hell. If my refund will be provided as usual then I might be use again tata unistores and Tata Neu.
25,Tata Neu,My issue has not been resolved and Big basket only seeks an apology and doesn't even care to provide compensation due to their error making us starve for a night..I need this to be looked into as i am noway to listen as i trusted Tata Neu and placed the order and not Big basket..
25,Tata Neu,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu points were not credited. Had to manually tell them all the order IDs. I wonder if Tata Neu has any information systems. Had to chase customer care team for quite a few days for this. Concern still unresolved.
25,Tata Neu,Pathetic customer support. Ticket closed without providing any resolution. No solution updated or communicated to me. Problem still exists. I've been following up for 3 days now. Your team lacks empathy and your backend system is also not helping. I will never use Tata Neu again and make sure none of my friends use it by telling them truth about poor quality of support you guys provide.
25,Tata Neu,"My issue stands unresolved. Neu has taken away one Mother Dairy Curd ordered on 28th April. Since then, I have spoken to Tata Neu and Bigbasket help line. Both were groping in the dark. Surprised to note that the good experience at the start turned out to be a nightmare. Issue is not the Curd or Rs. 47.25; it's the lack of coordination and problem solving. The delivery boy said that the item was spoilt/ bad. So refund would be initiated. Wonder! How the new app can be botched up by some, so soon. Not in conformity with Tata experience!!!!"
25,Tata Neu,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
25,Tata Neu,"TATA Neu needs to expand the products availability. There are many products which are available on Amazon, Flipkart or even Jio but not on Tata Neu. I understand it will take a while to reach that stage but felt worth to share the feedback."
25,Tata Neu,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
25,Tata Neu,"Hi Team, I am raising the issue since 21st Apr 2022 and today is 03rd May 2022 .As of today the issue has not been resolved either by Tata Neu or your branch Big Basket where i placed the order. Its the responsibility of Tata Neu to be responsible to resolve this issue . Thanks & regards, sanjana reddy"
25,Tata Neu,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
25,Tata Neu,Bought through Tata Neu at bigbasket on promo stated that 10% neu coins would be awarded if purchase over 1200. Coins did not get credited for 72 hours post which grievance raised - neu got back stating 5% crecited in neu account and balance 5% if not credited one should get in touch with bigbasket??? How does bigbasket have ability to credit neu coins for a tata neu customer??? Why should tata neu holder chase bugbasket for 5% credit???
25,Tata Neu,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
25,Tata Neu,As Tata Neu is new therefore a lot of problems are coming in profile transferred to new profile from earlier profile on 1mg. mainly transfer of 1 mg cash to Tata Neu coins. Need to resolved quickly.
25,Tata Neu,Very poor service of Tata Neu Customer Care. Just 1 example 2 days ago I informed Customer Care that Mother Dairy Curd delivered was 4 days old when compared with the curd available on the Mother Dairy Vendors. Why Tata Neu can't deliver fresh products??? Even most of the groceries being delivered are minimum 1 month old. The above clearly shows that not only customer care but the complete team of Tata responsible for purchase of products and inventory Management is useless. Very Very Poor Show!
25,Tata Neu,Shitty service. I hasn't and wouldn't recommend Tata Neu to anyone.
25,Tata Neu,My order was supposed to be delivered by 2/may/2022. I still have not received it despite on continuous followups with customer care. I was promised by croma team my order would be delivered by 3/May/2022 and nothing happened. I received call today from Bluedart couriers and they said order will be delivered today (5/may/2022) and it still is not delivered. I was not being informed about delay in my order which is highly unsatisfactory. Had to multiple follow ups to get above info. Customer care representative was not able to provide me â€œgrievance email idâ€. Overall experience has been very bad and i wont be ordering anything from Tata Neu in future. In the age where you get groceries delivered in hours a Big brand like Tata is not able to deliver my order is simply unacceptable.
25,Tata Neu,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
25,Tata Neu,"twice i was told, I am eligible and will get cashback in 72 hrs or max 5 days. After 5 days I was told I was not eligible as per T&C. But those T&C are no where written and available to end customer. Clicking on BigBasket banner on Tata Neu did not show any terms and conditions but just took me to Big Basket. That's not fair!!!"
25,Tata Neu,"My e mail is patra_tbk@yahoo.com in AirAsia,where as in Tataneu my e mail is patra.tbk@gmail.com which needs to be corrected as patra_tbk@yahoo.com. As I booked air tickets through TATANEU-Air Asia,the benefits should be credited not withstanding variation in e mail address in AirAsia and Tata Neu."
25,Tata Neu,"1. Cashback offers that are available on Croma are not available on Tata Neu linked Croma 2. No option to purchase from another Croma account from single Tata Neu account 3. If someone wishes to avail offer twice, it is not possible"
25,Tata Neu,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish.

Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu platform is not able to deliver my booked item. It doesn't refund my money. Very poor service.
25,Tata Neu,"Hi Tata Neu,You never resolved the issue and Never your Brand Big Basket cares customers who trust a Brand like Tata..Tata Neu is responsible for my issue and it is not caring to contact it's own brand with a resolution rather than dragging issue since 18days causing distress ."
25,Tata Neu,I have been using big basket and 1mg for a long time and have bb star and diabetic care plans. Since the very start the Tata Neu is very buggy platform. Initially the payments didnâ€™t go through and I was forced to complete payment at bigbasket app. Now for several days I have been facing several issues like coins not credited to account and the resolution time is very long. Secondly the customer service is clueless they just do not understand the issue even after mailing proper order no. and transaction no. Still they are unable to resolve the issue.
25,Tata Neu,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
25,Tata Neu,"Still havenâ€™t been told as to by when I will receive the product. Every time I am told that a customer care representative will call, but havenâ€™t received any call. Tata Neu has taken almost INR 10000 for a luxury product and not delivered it on time or even given a date for delivery."
25,Tata Neu,"Very Bad service from Croma, Tata Capital,Tata Neu. In 14-20 Days Not got the refund."
25,Tata Neu,Got the prompt solution. Good work Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,Order item is not delivered even after 4 days of scheduled arrival date. No body at Tata Neu and Croma is able to solve
25,Tata Neu,My surname is incorrect in the Profile of Tata Neu App...I have asked to correct it...but it is not yet corrected.
25,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is bouquet of Tata services under 1 platfoorm. It would've been better if Tata management understand what are existing issues in existing services before actually creating this bouquet. I placed order for refrigerator which was showing next day delivery. As it didn't delivered i cancelled order next day 11pm. 2-3 call center representatives confirmed my cancelation, still despatched refrigerator after 7 days. I didn't except the order, still it was marked delivered. Now my money got stucked as the product is showing delivered. Now i have to convince your team that i have not received the product and money should be refunded. Now this will tell you there are issues in so many levels in Croma service."
25,Tata Neu,Arrogant customer care agent. Very indifferent. Plus rigid policies. Basic things which must be done through app generally need calls etc and is a waste of time. Very unfriendly UI. Cannot recommend Tata Neu to anyone in this current form. I trusted Tata brand and tried but very disappointed.
25,Tata Neu,Issue was that neu coins not awarded for Air Asia as middle name was not updated in Tata Neu profile. I find this very rigid and inflexible. And ways to find excuse to not give neu coins.
25,Tata Neu,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
25,Tata Neu,I am very happy with my experience with Tata Neu so far.
25,Tata Neu,"Superb, Awesome, Tremendous, Excellent Services i have received from Tata Neu Team."
25,Tata Neu,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
25,Tata Neu,Very Bad service from Croma Tata Capital Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,"Even after raising my issue almost 8 days back, no update from Tata Neu team on my concern. Customer service executives are clueless."
25,Tata Neu,"Provide Tata Neu coins for online payment methods like scan,rechsrge"
25,Tata Neu,"I was getting emails from Tata Neu with creating any account but the agent is asking to create an account and turn off the notifications in setting, after account is created. Worst Resolution received."
25,Tata Neu,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
25,Tata Neu,No common sense is resolving issues. No knowledge of the Tata Neu App
25,Tata Neu,Very bad apps my order is 01/05/2022 . My account to pay.2834.10. my order decline my payment is not refund in 14 day very bad Tata NeuCroma team
25,Tata Neu,"I had purchased on Split Ac on 03.05.2022 in Tata Neu Portal. As per the offer, the standard installation is Rs. 499/- plus GST. I have the screen shut with me. But your installation agency demanded Rs. 1500/- plus GST which I have raised through written complain and through the Custmer Care. Custmet Care complaint no. is 970081. Even though the AC has been delivered on 08.05.2022 still it is not installed."
25,Tata Neu,Hopeless Tata Neu should close immediately
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a cheater and fraudster team who dont care issues raised.Just throw paltry amount and wash your hands is the attitude and way of business
25,Tata Neu,Product is good but Tata Neu / Croma need to take ownership for the delivery date which they promise... Promising next day delivery and delivering after 3 days Customer care guys dont have much to do except telling what is already known to customer
25,Tata Neu,My matter is yet to be resolved. And still no communication from Tata Neu. Thanks for service
25,Tata Neu,"CC Exe are all dumb. That can't understand a simple equation. The girl and the boy kept on talking about cashback, which was not the issue at all. The issue is about 2 Digital Gift Cards which I used online & afterwards I cancelled the order. The GC balance is now showing Zero . This has be be refilled/recharged ., or refunded to Wallet of Croma/Tata Neu if has any. The amount is 5000 & 500 Rs respectively. GC No 1001340042219485. & 1001340048367920. Education UR call center agents."
25,Tata Neu,Worst app and worst service I had done booking in taj hotel through it but donâ€™t get any Tata Neu points.worst experience
25,Tata Neu,The whole team at Tata Neu has no understanding of the amalgamation of all the Tata brands into one format and app .
25,Tata Neu,"We had Ordered Stevia powder on Tata Neu. When we receive the parcel, out of the two jars one jar was broken open and the powder was all over the envelope, which I checked only upon my return to the city, on ninth May. However, that seems to be out of the return period and the customer care executives are still unable to help us in this matter."
25,Tata Neu,"My issue was not resolved. Even after putting order through Tata Neu App, i was told that order was through Bigbasket. I have downloaded BB but haven't done any transaction."
25,Tata Neu,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
25,Tata Neu,My simple concern was to Change my Name as it was incorrect and taken automatically by the app. I have no idea how an application takes false name automatically. It was very simple query that can be addressed easily by the huge firm like Tata. But I had to delete all my tata accounts for this issue. How bad can an application be. Pathetic experience. Poor support and bad experience with Tata Neu.
25,Tata Neu,"Forget friends, will not recommend Tata Neu to enemies also. Worst customer care."
25,Tata Neu,"It's my first order with tata i had thought it might good because it's brand it's totally fail & the worst experience i had ever face on E-commerce site, i had order which neither place or not properly file as complain till email. I had contacted to customer care they wasted my 1 to 2 Day's in chat only not file the complaint after that i had find somewhere to wrote email then it get resolve if i have stay depended on tata customer service i might never get my money retune... First think first customer is the priority who trust & spend online money if we didn't get the proper response it's the trust loss easily what i had face with tata i pray no one will face in future because it's hard to earn money & difficult u to understand how it matter when someone continues contact but no result come only the new chat & new customer care person contact..... Well thanks for retune I'll be never do the shopping from Tata Neu again because due to this only i had lost the other offers thanks..."
25,Tata Neu,Thank you so much Tata Neu good process and good service thank you so much Tata team. ??â¤ï¸
25,Tata Neu,"I haven't been able to login in Tata Neu App after download, I have emailed error screenshot to customercare@tataneu.com but no reply or assistance received till now."
25,Tata Neu,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
25,Tata Neu,"I have applied for a PL through Tata Neu Qik Loan for INR 1,90,000 for 36 months, on 12th May. The digital KYC system was down and I opted for physical KYC collection. No one has come to collect those documents, nor called me. I raised a ticket, numbered, 1017592, last week. I have been following up with customer service, but all I am getting are empty promises to solve this issue within 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Nothing has happened so far! Please solve this issue. I need the funds at the earliest. My son has surgery on 10th June."
25,Tata Neu,Pathetic & Horrible shopping experience with Tata Neu App
25,Tata Neu,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
25,Tata Neu,I bought from Tata Neu because I love the Tata brand but this time Croma failed to prove its services and customer service. Bad customer service.
25,Tata Neu,Very poor response from Tata Neu. No solution has been provided after multiple followup.
25,Tata Neu,My Tata Neu points got deducted yet I had to pay cash on delivery
25,Tata Neu,"I would like to inform you that I was assured that I would receive 5% nue points on my purchasing through Tata neu app. I called in month of April 2022 on customer care no of Tata Neu App (before my purchase) and was Informed regarding the same i.e. 5% neu points. But till date I have received the 5% neu points of my purchasing. Moreover, I had a talk on 13th May 2022 with Mr. Mehul and Ms. Bhawan( Supervisiors), they also assured me that I will get the points in my account ( mobile no 880067866) but till date I havenâ€™t received the 5% nue points . Kindly do the needful ."
25,Tata Neu,I've not received my Tata Neu coins for aarch transaction till now!
25,Tata Neu,"Never will recommend Tata Neu. Will not make that mistake. Its been more than 3 weeks, i havent got my Tata neu coins so far. It has been a pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Made a big mistake booking Gateway Chikmaglur through Tata Neu. Didnt get the best price and also, was not aware the price didnt include food. It didnt even cover breakfast. Tata Neu booking hid this fact from me and didnt show the price with food included. Ended up paying a huge amount for 2 days stay. And to top it, didnt even get Tata Neu coins for it."
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a terrible app. And the customer service is pathetic!
25,Tata Neu,No solution despite repeated follow ups with CS on purchases made through Tata Neu/ Big Basket & Croma. Too many bugs in the system.
25,Tata Neu,Not providing good service. Flipkart and Amazon much better than Tata Neu. Will not recommend to others.
25,Tata Neu,"My order is still not delivered. Money is deducted but no response on my order delivery from Tata Neu. Being an employee of Croma , This is my worst every shopping experience. If anyone is reading this, Please call me on 9819777107 to resolve my query"
25,Tata Neu,You guys are still havenâ€™t teething issues with fluency of app. Hope to see that everything will be good in coming days. All the best. I am happy to see Tata Neu finally here.
25,Tata Neu,"my Tata Neu points dispute not yet resolved, even after so many follow up on mail and phone."
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Coins not credited even after repeated mails & complaints over calls
25,Tata Neu,Worst experience. Never face in any e commerce site.Shame on Tata Neu
25,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu / BB have been sending messages on Neu Coins/ Neu membership etc. Incessantly. I have disabled all notifications on the app at my end, yet they continue. Please differentiate between service messages, like delivery status and promotional messages. Its very bugging to be spammed by such a respected brand"
25,Tata Neu,Ticket resolution time longer than any other e-commerce websites. How will Tata Neu compete with those!!!
25,Tata Neu,"It is a great initiative. Just need to fix some bugs and app speed issue. At support end, need to train for better response rather than just saying uninstall and install the app. Rest, I am very proud of Tata Neu App - Desh ka App,"
25,Tata Neu,A bunch of crooks and stealers. There is no way Tata Neu can survive infront of Amazon and Flipkart
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu App need a lot of improvement. Payment does NOT work well. Resolve all issues ASAP.
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Customer Service Sucks. The agentâ€™s don't have the information about the offers and about the app.
25,Tata Neu,This was my first purchase from Tata Neu as I was looking for an alternative to Amazon/ Flipkart. But I am very disappointed with the service. I never had such experience while doing any shopping on Amazon/ Flipkart in last 10-12 years. Now i will have no choice but to go back to Amazon/ Flipkart only. Thanks for the great experience.
25,Tata Neu,Tata Neu app is dead slow
25,Tata Neu,Ever since Tata Neu was introduced overall experience with all your Apps are bad. Did not expect such a half boiled App from TATA!
25,Tata Neu,"I have been waiting for response on my Tata Neu Points and its not answerable from last one month. All are saying same thing, system is being updated."
25,Tata Neu,Really very nice service provided by the customer care team. Ms Preeti has attended me very well and resolved all my doubts in very poliote manner. What i expect from Tata is the same. Maintain this. Thanks Tata Neu Team.
25,Tata Neu,"Very bad service. I had applied for a Personal Loan on 21st. April. All my paperwork are done. Even the e-mandate procedure was done and Tata Neu took 118/- from my Account, but it's been about 40 days gone. Still the LOAN amount of 1 Lakh is not disbursed ."
26,Croma,No one understand my problem/query. No one took efforts to resolve it. First the employee in Croma Chandigarh have no knowledge. They are not conform me about how i get neu coins. All employees are full  lack of knowledge/ schemes
26,Croma,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
26,Croma,"I really had terrible experience, as the pick up store was changed without informing, plus when I visited another store the stock did not last, while it showed ready to pick up in my app and above it no one cancelled the order as promised by Croma employee.

Above it my payment is not  processed though its 15th day, and that too, I had to make a complaint for refund; should it have been suo moto, I would be more happy as this created a negative impression in my mind about Neu that in future if there is issue with order, my funds are not safe, as refunds are not done on time neither Neu team cares about informing status to customer on itself, it is the customer who has to go and beg for his refund.

I would never prefer croma or neu for any shopping.
"
26,Croma,"In spite of requesting almost everyday since 2 months, I have still not received a call from the Fraud Dept who is supposed to detect the fraud happening at Croma Borivali"
26,Croma,"I had a pathetic experience with neu customer care. My order is not yet delivered and it's delayed by 3 days now. Everytime I called the customer care, they told the same thing to wait till EOD, and that they are escalating the matter. But i got no solution. I have such a terrible experience with Tata neu and Croma that I'll never buy stuff from here again, and will recommend my friends to not buy from here too."
26,Croma,Thanks to all the customer care executives for prompt support each time. Heartily thanks to Grievance officer Tata Neu. Wishes all the very best to wonderful team of Croma. Keep it up. 
26,Croma,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"
26,Croma,"In one case where I was unable to place an order for IPhone 13 on Croma website was not resolved after 120 hours. Whereas, in second case, when I booked again an iPhone 13, on Croma online, it was expeditiously resolved. He clearly understood the issue and articulated well and resolved in quick time. "
26,Croma,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
26,Croma,"Thanks U Tata neu ,Croma "
26,Croma,If Neu and Croma are of Same Venture i.e Tata then cashback points should be same. Not a good experience of purchasing the product 
26,Croma,Croma store will not listen the customer i have not recieve 580 coin in 30 days and the store behaviour is very poor 
26,Croma,"Cromartie executive didn't know the details of Tata Neu app,how customers would benefit from the app."
26,Croma,"Query is pending for more than 3 weeks now.
Croma has closed the query several times without proper reasoning and no action taken by TataNeu team.
"
26,Croma,Curbside pickup from nearest Croma store should be arranged for fast delivery. 
26,Croma,It was very bad experience with Croma
26,Croma,"Pathetic pathetic pathetic pathetic service by Tata Neu. My order was delivered on Wednesday and till Saturday Installation has not happened. I need compensation of Rs 5,000 for delay in installation. I have not received installation SMS also till today. Whereas other online company as well as Croma is also providing installation of electronic product in 24 hours. "
26,Croma,Unsatisfactory resolution. Poor ethical value displayed by the Croma
26,Croma,Give your website team a tight slap on there face . What shit web page have they made on both Tata neu and Croma  it always loads  only while opening them . Make Tata neu and Croma reachable more by delivering to all locations in india foreign companies like amazon are delivering at all india level but you are not delivering . 
26,Croma,Pathetic & worst experience ever. if u r giving anything free also still wonâ€™t consider from Croma 
26,Croma,"For something as straightforward as my issue (credit of Neucoins for a purchase at Croma store for which the copy of Physical receipt was provided to Customer Care), the amount of time it took to resolve the issue, is preposterous. Secondly, even after the issue was apparently resolved, I kept getting emails (I got at least 3) that it will take another 48 hours for the issue to be resolved. The entire thing seems extremely disjointed "
26,Croma,Why Croma toll free number is chargeable? 
26,Croma,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address..!!?? Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good."
26,Croma,"Customer support Bahut hi achha hai yaar aaplogo ka Matlab Main tata neu ke Whatsapp chat ke through Kisi bhi tata ke partner website jaise tata cliq, Croma, big basket,1mg se chat kar sakta hoon aur woh bhi 24hrs kabhi bhi. Matlab gajab ka customer support hai aaplogo ka "
26,Croma,Need some what plan to exchange Croma voucher to tata cliq cash
26,Croma,"Nobody cares about customer issue, for August 15th purchase of TV still nobody installed from Croma. Today is 9th October. This is how your customer care service is working."
26,Croma,I had great faith with Tata group and ordered Iphone 13promax with Croma inspite of paying Rs119900 on 29th sep 22 you guys couldnt sent it till 8th of Oct 22. very very pathetic services from a very reputed company I am ashamed to place order with you. You must be very proud wasting customers money and time. I want immediate solution deliver it today or return back my money immediately.
26,Croma,"Worst consumer experience ever! The issue was explained in detail to the local manager of Croma in Jalandhar, Punjab."
26,Croma,"I was given good amount of explanation on my query.  Although, I was not very satisfied after placing the order because I received a text message from Croma asking that the payment was not completed and they provided a new link for payment (also tata new app said product not processed until 1 day after purchase). I had purchased the product using Tata Neu App and no Cost EMI option. It is confusing for the customer and might end up paying twice for the product. After the call, I am assured that the product purchase is completed and it is in shipped status. Eagerly waiting for the product to get delivered. Thank You Team."
26,Croma,"Despite buying multiple products from a reputed firm like Croma, I am being harrassed with non replacement of faulty product despite upfront payment. Very bad experience. I bought from Croma because of Tata Group name!!!"
26,Croma,"Worst service, would never suggest Tata neu and Croma to anyone in my life "
26,Croma,"I tried to explain to each agent that I had not cancelled the Croma Order after paying the total amount by Credit Card and that there was a fraud being committed at either Croma or in the NeuCoins department of Tata Neu, but nobody has taken it seriously. I have bee defrauded of 120 - 6 = 114 New Coins"
26,Croma,"Cannot find where to contact customer care executives on your app. I bought a fridge from Croma for over 1.5L, wanted to lodge a complaint for the fridge through Neu app but it was very complicated and i have not done so far."
26,Croma,I got harrassed for seven days without any proper explanation as to what caused the order to vanish from my account. The customer care executives kept on giving me 24 hours wait time to resolve my issue. Finally after 12 days I got my refund but I didn't get the refund of Croma voucher that I also used on the order.
26,Croma,"My Query Is not reslove yet. I Just received Part payment of 4,990 into the card remaining - 25,000 + 25,000 Used by Gift card That's Not refunded yet, Even not reflect into Old gift card, even not received in Croma Wallet."
26,Croma,"My Query Is not reslove yet. I Just received Part payment of 4,990 into the card remaining - 25,000 + 25,000 Used by Gift card That's Not refunded yet, Even not reflect into Old gift card, even not received in Croma Wallet."

26,Croma,7 day ho gya mara koi hal nahi hoa Croma team na muja ak bar bi call nahi ki na mara koi hal kiya very bad
26,Croma,"Query was not resolved. I was told that someone would call me regarding my issue, i.e., the neu points for my AC purchased from Croma not reflecting in my account. No one called me. I didn't get my points either...."
26,Croma,"According Croma sales man I spend through your app, but no points indication is there"
26,Croma,I called several times for the installation of my new AC. But no body came to installed yet. Very bad experience with Croma. Very poor service and customer care is useless. I am going to return the product.
26,Croma,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
26,Croma,"ordered one Electronic product from Croma through TATA Neu on 4-4-2022, i selected for Order delivery and the Delivery Adress was 7-2-7/21, Road no 5, Durga Nagar colony in Hyderabad. Some how order got placed in Mumbai. Which is not any of my fault, i have proper adress From my side. After order placed in Mumbai store, i was seeing order is ready to pick up in Mumbai Croma store, which is rediculous. I can't travel from Hyderabad to Mumbai just to pick up a order. I raised an ticket and some person from Mumbai Croma called and i explained the problem. He said he will get back to me. After long time waiting i tried to call him and he is receiving my call and he is playing some recorded message about a costumer care number, which infact not working. Which is rude way to bahave with a costumer. If both Neu Team and Croma team were having proper coordination, this issue could have resolved within 30 minutes. The product which i ordered is in a croma store ( Karnanghat in Hyderabad) just beside my house. Because of your incompetence in resolving the issue on time, i had to cancel my order."

26,Croma,"Need to improve on Product availability on Tata Croma , either at stores or for online purchase"
26,Croma,Was not able to resolve my points credit from Tata Croma (purchase of laptop from store)
26,Croma,I tried multiple time but no executive was assigned. In electronics section you will be able to see no of items bought from Croma however there was no reward coins credited to my account. In most cases I have used my credit card and made the payment.
26,Croma,"Overall very bad experience, my query still not resolved and even Tata neu points not added in my account as per Croma manager , select city walk commitment and also no one call back me from tata neu it seems no one interested in resolving my query"
26,Croma,"Iâ€™ve already waited for 3+ days, thereâ€™s still no resolution. Ticket Id#732360. Haven't received Neucoins for my past 3 transactions on Croma amounting to 1,83,580/-"
26,Croma,"There is a lack of clear information & communication regarding placing orders & NeuCoins reward through TataNeu Portal since itâ€™s redirecting to multiple portals (such as Croma, TataCLiQ, BigBasket, etc.). So the time taken to resolve query & level in the quality meter atleast upto which a concern has to be properly resolved is definitely a miss !!"
26,Croma,The customer service guy was not even pretending to understand my query. I asked for a tracking code for my 13k worth consignment. All they did was redirecting me to the product tracking page with minimal info. Never buying from Neu or Croma!
26,Croma,"I visited the Croma store at Vasant Kunj to purchase two Voltas Air Conditioners. I requested the bill to be made with my GST so I could claim the benefit. While making the bill I was informed that they couldn't enter my full name as the records, entered by someone at a Croma store while making a purchase earlier, had been registered with just my surname. What started then was a process that would put even the most leaden-footed bureaucracies to shame. First I was told to download the TATA Neu app and asked to change my name there. When the app didn't respond, I was informed that it takes only three characters and the name will have to be changed by calling customer care. I called customer care and had Mr. Mahesh attend the call who was very receptive. He asked me to email my Adhar Card and then issued me a ""ticket"". This email was sent at 7 PM and at 12.54 AM I received an email from Mr. Amit Shah asking me to send a Government Approved ID. This was most strange as this email was in response to the email in which I had sent the Adhar Card as an attachment. On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there! This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further."

What started then was a process that would put even the most leaden-footed bureaucracies to shame. First I was told to download the TATA Neu app and asked to change my name there. When the app didn't respond, I was informed that it takes only three characters and the name will have to be changed by calling customer care. I called customer care and had Mr. Mahesh attend the call who was very receptive. He asked me to email my Adhar Card and then issued me a ""ticket"". This email was sent at 7 PM and at 12.54 AM I received an email from Mr. Amit Shah asking me to send a Government Approved ID. This was most strange as this email was in response to the email in which I had sent the Adhar Card as an attachment. On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there! This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further."
26,Croma,"The support is good, problem is with the the service and product. Buying experience at both Tata Neu and Croma were underwhelming. Tata Neu fails to complete payment and Croma always succeeds to show products as available until you complete the payment."
26,Croma,Even after purchasing in thousands from Croma the points didnâ€™t get credited to the Tata Neu points. Have been following up with the customer service for past few weeks but NO RESPONSE. Totally frustrated.
26,Croma,No clarity on how police will work. Will Croma offer applies in this app?
26,Croma,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
26,Croma,"Online Order was placed on 12.04.2022on Tata Neu .Material delivered on 15.04.2022 however the date of delivery was upto 14.04.2022. Till date (20.04.2022) AC has not been installed and no communication regarding installation . Contacted customer service representative many times but they are not even able to tell me whether installation of AC shall be done by the representative of Croma or not. And if yes, then when it will be installed. Very P athletic conditions and against the brand name. On the site of croma(Tata Neu) the installation date was from 48-72 Hrs. Now , even I canâ€™t return the product."
26,Croma,"Having already given feedback once, I am getting an email every day asking for feedback. What kind of feedback do you want for spamming? Also, I was told by the Croma store owner that the ACs would be installed in 48 hours. It's 96 hours now and the ACs are still to be installed. I have been calling repeatedly over the past 2 days and all I get to hear from the installation team is, it'll happen in the next 30 minutes!"
26,Croma,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
26,Croma,"I don't think I can recommend Tata Neu to anyone at this point. I just placed 2 orders through Tata Neu so far and I faced major technical issues. On top of it, your customer care executive mentioned that the servers are down since more than a day. This is very disappointing and left me with a bad experience using Tata Neu. I'm still unable to get the product I needed from Croma, even after multiple follow ups."
26,Croma,Didn't get my Neu points due to misguidance from a Croma employee. However there must some way to resolve this as I made a genuine purchase of tata product.
26,Croma,I donâ€™t think my issue with Neu coins was resolved for one of the order placed at BB. Hoping to get the resolution for Croma order .

26,Croma,"Tata Neu is poorest service as I have seen. No refund amount credited after 9 days of refund initiation. When you don't know how to manage services then why you start new services. Poorest service of Croma, Tata cliq, etc."
26,Croma,"Worst shopping experience I have ever had. The customer service personnel are unable to resolve the issues. 10 days after making a successful transaction, there was no order ID. Tata Neu customer service people asked me to call Croma and Croma personnel said there is no such order ID. I asked customer service personnel to escalate the issue and asked for a new order to be placed as the transaction was successful, but they said it was beyond their purview. Pathetic and most harrowing experience. You guys need to go a long long way to be in competition with such careless customer service. God bless you. I am disappointed to see my favourite brand go this way. ??"
26,Croma,My issue is still not solved and I havenâ€™t still got any reply on the status of my request. Purely worst experience. My issue is regarding Tata Neu coins which still have not been added to my account even after 2 weeks of my purchase from Croma store.
26,Croma,Bad experience on the standard installation charges not communicate for Croma split AC.
26,Croma,"I Buyed a product from Croma store, So just wanted to know about mine Tata Neu points but didn't got any response"
26,Croma,"Not sure , I have ordered Croma ac as part of flash deal label on Neu app which was later cancelled , as i felt cheated by Tataâ€™s . the same product was available on another 2 platform amazon and TataCLiQ with exactly same price and sold by croma with free standard installation. Whereas when I inquired at Neu chat support they told me I need to pay installation charges. When the seller is same , brand is company owned , you are labelling it under flash sale then why such discrepancies across channel. Never expected this kind of unethical practice from brand Tata"
26,Croma,no thing called service provided by Croma. the worst online etailer.
26,Croma,"Very slow peocessing and time wasting App. I purchased Voltas 1.5 ton AC deivered on18 Apr 22 and delayed installed on 24 Apr 22. After installation 1 day AC stop cooling and error occured 5d & 6E. I register complaint on daily to daily min 5 time with croma cust care but till 02 May no technician visit at my house and till AC is off road/not working. Very bad experience with Croma, Voltas & Tata neu app. Waste my time, waste my money....."
26,Croma,Not able to make payment online to purchase the iPhone and there is not same offer in offline Croma store. Ended up paying extra in Croma store rather than ordering on tataneu
26,Croma,I had purchased mobile phone from Croma n was told tataneu points would be added to my account within 48 hrs of purchase but still haven't been added after over a month.. Also i stayed at taj malabar resort n spa cochin for 5 days n was told once u check out the points would be added to your account.. Its almost a week & no points have been added.. Inspite of complaining to customer service still the tataneu account shows 0 points..
26,Croma,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
26,Croma,"I placed request for my speakers and executives on call talked like I'm the one complaing without any merit to my problem and kept saying that it can't be taken back and kept refusing to send up a pick up team and made a request to speaker company for repairing rather than arranging for a pickup. I used to shop at amazon and I tried Croma for the 1st time just because I love the TATA, now this seems to be turning as nightmare for me atleast. SR27042200618"

26,Croma,"I Chat Daily on Your Customer Care Chat Section regarding The Ac, Ac is Delivered but today is 2 days Passed And Installation is not yet done. Also app shows me your Ac is installed, But this is Totally Wrong because Ac is not installed, I am daily Chat and they said ""please wait for 3 Days. Keep In mind if you want to be a big brand than improve your service otherwise customer switch to Amazon, Because Amazon Fulfill Ac installation in 24 hours from delivery of products. Also Your Croma Helpline is not Working, â˜¹ï¸"
26,Croma,"I installed this app, and when I wanted to make a transaction (around â‚¹9,500) at Westside it rejected, imposing a limit of â‚¹5,000. If I am making a transaction then it isn't upto you whether I will perform a transaction of lesser amount. When I contacted customer care to provide necessary neu points they straight away rejected, stating that this is an offline transaction. Then I did another transaction of â‚¹700 in Croma, the app straight away gave an error. What's the point of using this app where I cannot get neu points and the transaction doesn't succeed. Sorry but I am not going to use this customer unfriendly app."
26,Croma,I have been given a TATA Qik EMI card which has a limit of 100000 but is not showing up as a payment option when I try to shop in the Croma website through the app. I dont see a point of having a card with limit when I can use it
26,Croma,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
26,Croma,"1. Cashback offers that are available on Croma are not available on Tata Neu linked Croma 2. No option to purchase from another Croma account from single Tata Neu account 3. If someone wishes to avail offer twice, it is not possible"
26,Croma,"Talking about TATA neu, one can say it's successful only if the below conditions are met: 1. Most of your products are undeliverable outside metro cities and so far after raising so many concerns nothing being done. So why would I buy 1 product with TATA and others look for somewhere. 2. Though bringing of all the items under TATA was good through Neu, there are many products missing from the online store. I would suggest all the products to be run on a single app other than using 1mg, Croma or a TATA cliq."
26,Croma,"I have place Symphony cooler on tata neu app, it was not showing under my order section. I called customer care thrice and they confirmed that they have received my order request and suddenly I got order cancellation email from tata Croma the day I was waiting for my product to be delivered. Is this a joke going on."
26,Croma,"Very Bad service from Croma, Tata Capital,Tata Neu. In 14-20 Days Not got the refund."
26,Croma,"I don't have any issue with customer care but my concern is for Croma. First time i received defective piece (someone used piece), so initiated return and second time ordered same piece but this time damaged parcel ( with opened condition there is no thermocol on bottom ). When I requested for immediate new piece in another 72 hrs there is no ownership at all. Based on this personal experience strongly not recommended for anyone else. Many things has to be improved quality, customer care ownership, application is very slow, order tracking not up to date ( portal got updated after 2 days once product delivered)."
26,Croma,Order item is not delivered even after 4 days of scheduled arrival date. No body at Tata Neu and Croma is able to solve
26,Croma,"Tata Neu is bouquet of Tata services under 1 platfoorm. It would've been better if Tata management understand what are existing issues in existing services before actually creating this bouquet. I placed order for refrigerator which was showing next day delivery. As it didn't delivered i cancelled order next day 11pm. 2-3 call center representatives confirmed my cancelation, still despatched refrigerator after 7 days. I didn't except the order, still it was marked delivered. Now my money got stucked as the product is showing delivered. Now i have to convince your team that i have not received the product and money should be refunded. Now this will tell you there are issues in so many levels in Croma service."
26,Croma,Very Bad service from Croma Tata Capital Tata Neu
26,Croma,Very bad apps my order is 01/05/2022 . My account to pay.2834.10. my order decline my payment is not refund in 14 day very bad Tata NeuCroma team
26,Croma,One last time using Croma to book Electronics. No update on MI TV installation even after 2 days
26,Croma,"I have placed an order from Tataneu in Croma online, money was debited from my account, transaction was successful but the order was not placed. Customer care was not able to help with the issue, they say issue was escalated to concerned team and it'll take 3days to resolve. Why do you need 3 days to check on a simple issue with a transaction?"
26,Croma,My order for a smart watch was canceled after the contractual delivery date without any advance information. I was to gift the same to my spouse and missed the occasion due to non delivery of the gift . I do not think TATA required working capital and blocked my fund for almost a week and canceled the order. If adequate stocks were not available the order should not have been accepted. My experience with Tataneu/ Croma was really bad. The smart watch was promised to be delivered at a discounted rate while ordering and immediately after cancellation of the order same watch was also available on the website for fresh ordering at a higher cost This reflects poor business ethics Regards Subrat Ph9920018821
26,Croma,Product is good but Tata Neu / Croma need to take ownership for the delivery date which they promise... Promising next day delivery and delivering after 3 days Customer care guys dont have much to do except telling what is already known to customer
26,Croma,"please solved my issue. Dear sir, I have purchased the V-Gaurd Voltage stabiliser model VG-400 from TATA Neu app and then go through Croma on 15 may 2022. Till now my order is not shown in the TATA Neu app nor Croma. I am not sure if it will be ordered or not. i was purchased it urgently as its show delivery date is 19 may2022. Only translation details are shown in the TATA NEU app and the same is complained in TATA NEU and croma also but no response. with Regards SKMishra 9926094937/7987046120"
26,Croma,"CC Exe are all dumb. That can't understand a simple equation. The girl and the boy kept on talking about cashback, which was not the issue at all. The issue is about 2 Digital Gift Cards which I used online & afterwards I cancelled the order. The GC balance is now showing Zero . This has be be refilled/recharged ., or refunded to Wallet of Croma/Tata Neu if has any. The amount is 5000 & 500 Rs respectively. GC No 1001340042219485. & 1001340048367920. Education UR call center agents."
26,Croma,You all just make fool to the customers. Very bad experience with Tata Croma.
26,Croma,Tata 's image is going to a new low. Selling such low quality products online. Croma is a fraud company. It's customer care number is fake. Croma after sales is the worst in India. Buy any products online at your own risk
26,Croma,I bought from Tata Neu because I love the Tata brand but this time Croma failed to prove its services and customer service. Bad customer service.
26,Croma,Customer care executive was not controlling croma technician. Croma technician was rude. Installation was not standard as per my suggestion and compare to other AC at my home. Technician was also not ready to learn any new thing and was doing work as per his mood.
26,Croma,"30 April & 5 May I purchased from Croma Calicut around 90000rs ; Store team told me Tata neu coins will added within 15 days ; very disappointed to say nothing will credited from any where, itâ€™s very cheating from the Tata side, Calicut manager and sales team not support, No one knows offers or coins details, I have lots of Corparate orders, I want to purchase from Croma or any Tata concerns,but these types of ambiance and attitude No need future buy from Croma; Sales staff as billing staff ;need improve the knowledge of offers and neu coins , TATA is a major leading company in our country So sadly said that Customer satisfaction nothing. Sadly say that I will never purchase from Tata Croma anymore."
26,Croma,"I purchased a mobile phone from Tata neu app. Instead of getting 5 neu coins per 100, I got less. I also emailed a video (which I had to make as this thing has he opened earlier to me also) to the customer care team. It clearly shows I have purchased from Tata neu, still the customer care is disagreeing an saying that I have purchased from Croma website. If you see my history of purchases, I have been buying a lot of items from Tata neu. I am not happy with the current status of my problem. Tata neu has less varieties and higher costs in some items, still supporting the app as itâ€™s made in India. But if the customer care wonâ€™t support properly, I am not likely to suggest this to my friends. Thanks."
26,Croma,I interacted with 2 agents. Both lacked initiative and basic information. They even shared outdated phone numbers for contacting Croma
26,Croma,My concern is still not resolved and I am waiting for reply from Croma regarding return. Till now I have followed steps told to me by customer care executive. Let's see
26,Croma,The app lags too much. Many people have given this app worst ratings still the app developers doing nothing... Croma only have few electronic product comparing to other shopping brands. It's like you don't care about customer experience and just care about 5% neu coins.
26,Croma,"Team Croma online, Doesn't care customer, doesn't respond quickly. I would not recommend anyone to buy products from Croma from my experience. Worst experience ever in buying online products at Croma."
26,Croma,"I ordered Elica Gas Stove from Tata Croma and its been already 48 hours plus since its delivered, but there is no update on when technician will come for installation. Everyday I am following up with tata croma customer care and they keep saying wait for 7 days max to resolve, I don't understand why does it take 7 days to send technician for installation? Do you expect customer to keep the item without opening or using until 7 days?"

26,Croma,No solution despite repeated follow ups with CS on purchases made through Tata Neu/ Big Basket & Croma. Too many bugs in the system.
26,Croma,The behave like bots and why you donâ€™t give the tracking id on the Croma very bad it is
26,Croma,"Bought Symphony air cooler on 1st May, 22 which stopped working on 6/5/22. Unable to get replacement. No return request honored. No one is coming to see what the problem is with the product. Tickets getting closed by Croma Backend team without technician attending it"
26,Croma,"My order is still not delivered. Money is deducted but no response on my order delivery from Tata Neu. Being an employee of Croma , This is my worst every shopping experience. If anyone is reading this, Please call me on 9819777107 to resolve my query"
26,Croma,I asked for Neu cash on 14th May against the purchase I made at Croma and till the date it has not been credited to my account. I deleted the app after this experience with you
26,Croma,Very casual and sub-standard customer care. Ticket closed without resolution. Croma purchase of 7 May yet to reflect on app and points credited. No resolution provided by your team.
26,Croma,I have called the customer care team twice to raise an issue of not getting Neu Coins for my recent purchase at Croma Stores. I have been promised that within 72 hours the coins would get credited in my account. I am still waiting. I dont intend to call anymore and would like to escalate. I feel being taken for a ride and this is my first bitter experience with Tata Group
26,Croma,Crap platform. Payments fail or go on hold. Shopping partner Croma did not acknowledge order due to use of gift card. One of the disgusting shopping & payment groups in India. Cheap homegrown mindset.
27,fraud,Problem not solved yet fraud ppl. 
27,fraud,Very fraud company 
27,fraud,"In spite of requesting almost everyday since 2 months, I have still not received a call from the Fraud Dept who is supposed to detect the fraud happening at Croma Borivali"
27,fraud,Never seen a worst customer service in my life ... 2months now my money is not refunded .. no call communication from them... If I call them all they say is wait for another 73hrs... Like that it's 2month now ... I won't use this app nor suggest anyone to use this fraud app either
27,fraud,"I tried to explain to each agent that I had not cancelled the Croma Order after paying the total amount by Credit Card and that there was a fraud being committed at either Croma or in the NeuCoins department of Tata Neu, but nobody has taken it seriously. I have bee defrauded of 120 - 6 = 114 New Coins"
27,fraud,"There is a fraud happening where the customers NeuCoins are deducted even though the customer had not cancelled any order. I have asked every agent to connect me to the Fraud Department, but I am yet to hear from the Fraud Team. It is frustrating to repeat the issue to a new agent everyday."
27,fraud,"Bed service, fraud company"
27,fraud,There is a fraud happening with NeuCoins being stolen from the customers

I am aghast to know â€œWe understand that due to some technical issue you got that error but we have done the required changes in your TataNeu profileâ€. I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure? What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch? What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue. As the 500 Neu Coins are â€œTataNeu Welcome NeuCoinsâ€ Request you to credit the same as soon as possible.

(Ticket Id#438417) Dear TataDigital Team, When I tried to register on the Tata Neu app it said ""hey you are already registered"" then I called up the help line to know that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com has been registered by ""Mayank Hooda"". My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4. Why it for the golden copy that my other accounts of Big Basket (exiting) connected by my mobile number changed to corporate ID Thank you & Regards, Vikas Pandey From: TataNeu Sent: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 7:15 PM To: VIKAS PANDEY Subject: Help us serve you better.

27,fraud,Doing fraud with customer
27,fraud,"Totally disappointed. If it was not Tata I would have thought you guys have started a new fraud. Akshay, the teleresponder, lacks knowledge and does not have any quality to interact with customer. just listen to the recording of conversation."
27,fraud,Bogus and fraud app
27,fraud,You are a fraud !
27,fraud,"TATA Neu is acting like a fraud organization. Even after successful payment, order is not confirmed due to ""so called"" technical issues and after 96 hours support team is unable to close the issue. Feeling cheated by TATA."
27,fraud,Poor service i never recomend this app to anyone and also help others to dont waste your time and give details to this aap all fraud
27,fraud,I had ordered a mobile phone for Rs 19249. And instead of mobile I was delivered an empty box. And I have complained about this thing too. But neither my phone has been delivered yet nor my money is being refunded. Your company has committed fraud with me.

27,fraud,"Your company is a fraud. I ordered a mobile phone. And delivered the empty box to me. I have also paid the money while ordering the phone. And now even after complaining, neither I got the phone nor my money. Your company is looting the customer's money by fraud."
27,fraud,Tata neu app is cheating its customers and not even refunding the amount they have deducted fraud APP
27,fraud,Your staff is totally doing fraud with clients and compelling never to deal with your company in any manner.
27,fraud,Very bad services. My issue didn't resolve till date. Tataneu is fraud. It has Misused my money. Need refund
27,fraud,Pathetic. Offers advertised are frauds to cheat customers. Coins are not credited and customers are harassed when they write emails.
27,fraud,You are completely fraud. You are not for customer
27,fraud,I never recommend this fraud website to anyone
27,fraud,Never recommend tata neu you are doing fraud with customer products not delivered from last 10 days
27,fraud,All of you involved in fraudulent activities and use cheap trick to save neu coin
27,fraud,All of you are sit there make us fool and do fraudulent activities.
27,fraud,Totally fraud
27,fraud,"I ll never recommend tata neu as they dont held responsbility if any issues arise due to their respective brands error. I am facing issues with Big Basket , both tata neu and Big Basket frauded and cheated me."
27,fraud,fraud company... not crediting my 5% neu coin ..as per tc
27,fraud,Tata Neu is a cheater and fraudster team who dont care issues raised.Just throw paltry amount and wash your hands is the attitude and way of business
27,fraud,have no response to my complaint on deliberate fraud
27,fraud,"fraud tata neu, i want compensasion of 1 lakh rupees"
27,fraud,Tata 's image is going to a new low. Selling such low quality products online. Croma is a fraud company. It's customer care number is fake. Croma after sales is the worst in India. Buy any products online at your own risk
27,fraud,Most fraudulent e-commerce portal operating in India. The Managing Director must be taken to task by way of criminal proceeding which I shall institute shortly. Also the customer services must be shut down.
28,pick up store,"I really had terrible experience, as the pick up store was changed without informing, plus when I visited another store the stock did not last, while it showed ready to pick up in my app and above it no one cancelled the order as promised by Croma employee.

Above it my payment is not  processed though its 15th day, and that too, I had to make a complaint for refund; should it have been suo moto, I would be more happy as this created a negative impression in my mind about Neu that in future if there is issue with order, my funds are not safe, as refunds are not done on time neither Neu team cares about informing status to customer on itself, it is the customer who has to go and beg for his refund.

I would never prefer croma or neu for any shopping.
"
29,250neu coins,My 250neu coins is still not received 
30,app,"Customer care response time very bad , not able to fix my issue last 1 month. Do not use more neu app "
30,app,Happy with the resolution
30,app,"Its been 20 days and i havent been provided with neither my product nor my refund. It's the worst service i have ever experienced 
I would recommend noone to use your app or your service "
30,app,Totally disappointed 
30,app,Many time email and customer care call than long time after may payment is refund 40 day around time so not happy this service 
30,app,Tata Neo app is full of problems. In this day and age for a group like Tata to put out such an app is SAD. Probably to combine so many things in on has taken toll. May take long before all starts to work well. Too many issues. 
30,app,"Your app is not as user friendly as I would have liked it to be. I have not spoken with any customer care executives, except chat automated response systems.I am unable to navigate the site while trying to get my selected items from my cart, towards the order confirmation and payments transactions page. I have been wanting to place further orders, but I am not able to move my selected and shortlisted items from my cart to the next step of confirming my delivery address and selection of payments options "
30,app,Very disappointed with TatNeu service
30,app,I just don't like the interface of the app
30,app,"You have to give the invoice below of the product ,as pdf form , don't sent it to email, you have to aslo give warrenty slip . Till I'm not received invoice email in this email id , i don't like it . Your tata neu app offer back option when I want to close it . But your product's condition is good delivery time is good. "
30,app,"Application improvement required (application is bulky & not user friendly & response time is high compare with others , important information & services tools need improvement with detailed information table etc.
Customer service improvement required
"
30,app,I don't think your service is promising as compared to other applications. It was my first mistake I guess and i am not using it again. You are just using tata's name.
30,app,Customer care is not great. I don't have time to give screenshotsof my chat and spend time. Even app is weird. Not allowed to cancel. Big price variation in less than 24 hours 10% variance
30,app,Customer executive is not understanding my query properly. As suppose to get 5% of neocoin i just got .33% i ordered it from croma website not from any third-party. And new app is not that upto date.
30,app,Sorry Tataneu very bad experience because order cancelled that's ok but refund process was delayed and slowly working on Tataneu app need to refund status checking  in the same Tataneu application  also thank you.
30,app,This is the worst app. I couldn't pay the big Basket order and I have paid through Google Pay which is an excellent app.
30,app,Very very poor service both management as well as apps
30,app,No provision of make payment again after failed payment in Neo app.
30,app,I hate this app
30,app,"thank you so much for suporting care executive and also tata neu app?
really thank you so much "
30,app,"The Big Basket application within Tata Neu  was a complete disappointment.  In the first try, I paid through NUE coins and cash. but the process aborted. I then had to pay cash all over again. I have now lost the NUE coin credit. 
when the delivery boy came he said he had double the order and he had brought them. I said I did not want it and he took them.away but I have not got the credit for the Neu coins."
30,app,It's a kind of disjointed customer care of different cos the universal app can't work like this 
30,app,The app is slow and the option to go to customer care is not shown immediately.  After washing machine is sent still no call for installation.
30,app,You have to do a lot of work on your app system
30,app,India no.1 useless app
30,app,Issue remains unresolved. Quicker revert appreciated. 
30,app,"Very worst experience with your customer care and app. I am struggling to book a installation for the washing machine product, but your team just said it will automatically happen and disconnected chat suddenly. Very bad and not going purchase anything in future
"
30,app,"I ordered some groceries from Big Basket and one item costing â‚¹ 58 has not delivered and instead I received an item of â‚¹ 20. Requested for replacement. Nothing happened. When I tried to chat online someone Named Ketan enquired all and said he will solve it but disappeared. Nothing happened. Order was dated 19/7/2022 for â‚¹ 1558.60.
Iâ€™m a disappointed customer. Will never use your app for any kind of purchase of groceries."
30,app,not planning to use the app again...the cashbacks are not guaranteed.   they come up with some reason when it is not tracked and they will ask for proofs. we don't record everything in mobile while doing. 
30,app,"Yes, I have a very bad feed for your website, application, and customer service. Your website suck in doesn't work properly and it has a very complicated procedure to place an order and track order on your website it doesn't show what size you have ordered and customer care executive is also not able to give the information about the what size I have ordered. this Is the first time I am ordering from Tata neu I hope it's not the last time."
30,app,"Customer care service is too bad in Tatanew. Usually, I won't trust any new application. But I trusted you because its a tata group. Now the service is worst"
30,app,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
30,app,Tata neu app is the worst payment app ever 
30,app,Not taking any discission only delegation happening and customer is suffering
30,app,"I visited tata neu app to buy TV , app redirected me to croma electronics , where i selected the product and billed , but i didn't receive 5% tata neu points"
30,app,"Good customer service, executive given me immediately answers which i wanted to know. The most thing is u people actually here & then response which is the comforting factor frm a customer point. Absolutely loved it, it's new & exciting. Since it's from the Tata group it'll be more trustworthy n reliable. I went to the app, it's great. I'm impressed wid ur idea n appreciate ur efforts. Thanks service. 
For Ticket - 1475994."
30,app,"When delivery of an order from Big Basket is delayed by over 3 hours or more, the least a customer can expect is to be informed via email or on the app about the delay and given an option to cancel the order online. 
In June and July twice my order at BB has been delayed by 3 hours or more, and I have had to call customer care myself to find out when or if the delivery would be made on that date, and after failing to get a satisfactory response have had to cancel the order both times."
30,app,"The executive kept on providing a standard response to each of my questions. He never believed in what I said, he just dismissed my claims outright without verifying it. Being a regular user of bigbasket app and now Neu app, he should have respected my knowledge on the same "
30,app,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
30,app,3rd class app and customer service.Fooling customers. Incapable customer care executives.
30,app,"Very pathetic system and customer care.
You have system error but have no regards to wasting customers time. One customer care says some thing other does not follow. Please close this app. There are better health apps in the market. Why are you tarnishing tata's brand name. "
30,app,Payment getaway disconnects  abruptly. This happens  quite  often. 
30,app,Better to decommission tata neu app.
30,app,"I really had terrible experience, as the pick up store was changed without informing, plus when I visited another store the stock did not last, while it showed ready to pick up in my app and above it no one cancelled the order as promised by Croma employee.

Above it my payment is not  processed though its 15th day, and that too, I had to make a complaint for refund; should it have been suo moto, I would be more happy as this created a negative impression in my mind about Neu that in future if there is issue with order, my funds are not safe, as refunds are not done on time neither Neu team cares about informing status to customer on itself, it is the customer who has to go and beg for his refund.

I would never prefer croma or neu for any shopping.

30,app,Improve your application 
30,app,I have been waiting well over a month for a number update to activate UPI registration and I am still waiting after having waited for long I have called customer service and was told that some one higher up will reachout to resolve the issue for me but till now nothing has happened effectively and I strongly believe that who ever working at Customer support is using this job as standby till they get some good job and hence the customer service is so badly performing making every  customers like me to get annoyed for choosing tata neu
30,app,Very happy
30,app,It's not clear from app or customer care that which transaction got neu coins and how to redeem. Query resolution chat has categorised hence we can't explain exact issue 
30,app,"Thanks again and sorry for rating Santosh K or is it Shridhar K , (sorry bad memory) wrongly as he had solved my problem by crediting Rs299.25 in my account but i had not checked the app and at that time did not know how to. "
30,app,Update the app version ASAP
30,app,"There is lot of problems in your customer care office and they are not solved my problem in your working 72 hours and they solve in 18days after I really bad experience in your company and I never expected from tata company, but now I will think to purchase in your app and never tell to any one because of your help center is not connect with customers, so thanks and sorry ðŸ˜"
30,app,There are no offers for new customer in this app and aslo I am not receivied any notification like if I purchase first time I get 250 neu coin and aslo I know that this app sending unecessary credit to many other customers but not sending me credited in my account  this is not fair to do like this then why we purchase from you 
30,app,Please add chat bot of customer care in the app. I have to invest much of my time to connect to customer care.
30,app,My issue were not address for a long time inspite of writing multiple emails. If the order received can't be delivered then tataneu  shouldn't accept in the first place. Really disappointed as there is no other way to get to customer care 
30,app,Not a good application. Ur user interface is not still perfect 
30,app,Very disappointed and not helping peoples from last 15 days your people just talk sweet words
30,app,Good customer service but app is not upto the expectations
30,app,Neu coins are earned only thro tata neu apps? 
30,app,"My querry resolved after 20 days of complaining , on every second day they mailed me to give them two more day. The app has healthy number of bugs and crashes , the app still needs too much of improvement i had suffred from same issue for twice regarding my order "
30,app,Not happy with Westside as I haven't got my product yet. 
30,app,Tata neu app was not updated bsnl recharge option and wallet balnce ading option also not updated
30,app,Return process is not user friendly.. your app needs improvement.
30,app,Please improve app UI itâ€™s very confusing 
30,app,I don't know much but its my first purchase from your app and 2 days past the expected delivery date still i don't receive my product this ia an unpleasant experience.
30,app,Very poor customer support experience - seems like the support are not aware enough of the Neu app features and are only happy to send repeatedly templatized/generic replies without fully trying to understand the issue. 
30,app,"I explained to the customer executive that I had pressed the 'Tata neucoin' button as my payment option, with only a small amount to be debited to my net banking account. Instead, the app took the entire amount from my bank account and did not redeem the neucoins at all. The customer executive could not explain what could have gone wrong and instead offered me some vague explanation. I therefore had to cancel the order. I later found out myself (by trial and error) that after selecting the neucoin option for payment, I had to press the edit option and indicate how many neucoins I wanted redeemed (the app defines the upper limit of redemption for each order) and then I paid a very small balance by net banking. Your customer exec could have explained this procedure to me (being the first time user), but she did not. "
30,app,"Faced difficulry in making online payment. Didn't find ""Submit""  button after filling up Credit Card details.  Never faced such problem on your other two apps. of Big Basket in last 2 years.
Suggestion is to make  your online payment procedure easier on this app. too . "
30,app,1st time i used this app.. An my money got Stuck.. Still I don't got refund
30,app,"Very much disappointed by the solutions provided by the Tata 1 mg Customer Care Teams.

1) I reached your team through Chat option, they informed me to call your Toll Free Number

2) When I called on the Toll Free Number, they told me mail my request to TataNeu

3) When I emailed TataNeu, they informed me to contact you (Please find the attached screenshot of the email)

and now you say you are unable to delete that account.

REALLY VERY POOR SERVICE BY YOUR TEAM..."
30,app,You must focus on the app since it's very slow . Also the executive seems she do not have much knowledge and tells anything which I will trust next time.
30,app,"Cannot expect such slow poor and delayed service from a Tata enterprise. Even the Tata Neu application has a lot of snags 
 "
30,app,Tata nu app sucks
30,app,I have been waiting for the the mail since 3 days. Since I  didn't pick call they closed my ticket. My issue isn't resolved yet as they aren't aware what nuecoins customer can see in tatacliq app and what sms we are receiving is totally different from the Neu app mentions.
30,app,"App needs to work on simultaneously login in in all the inside apps linked..gets difficult to sign in each time u go inside cliq or westside.and getting back to main screen after searching one product ,,need to scroll again from top to go the same item"
30,app,Very bad app
30,app,"Service is very disappointed, ....."
30,app,Extremely disappointing....Definitely my last through Tata Neu
30,app,"More than Customer care, it's the basic order processing & delivery issue, poor reflection of the status in your Tata Neu app. is the fundamental problem, Customer care can not handle the basic issues with order fulfillment & delivery."
30,app,I chatted on Neu it redirected me to Cliq customer care who in turn directed me to tata luxe .... and in all cases it was pathetic... have uninstalled the app as I now no longer find value in it... amazon rocks
30,app,"The app needs lot of improvement, hangs, lags a lot. Not user friendly. Customer care needs to be efficient. Bad experience while shopping. More than half of my orders got cancelled without notice. Have a look at amazon, flipkart. Better offers, better app. I have love for tata brand, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m using this app. Otherwise itâ€™s not worth. Everybody i know has same feedback."
30,app,I'm not satisfied by the resolution as I was asked to cancel the order- the offer which was showing didn't apply hence I was inquiring the same where I was told we can't do anything as the offer is from bank ! should we not trust CROMA offers ?
30,app,"I am extremely disappointed with the current experience.
My question is if you don't have cellphone available then why my order is confirmed.
Now, i have to wait for 5-7 working hours and taking follow up with my bank."
30,app,I think you are a fake app as I am unable to know the status of my prepaid order
30,app,Not happy this service
30,app,Telugu known customer executives also to be appointed 
30,app,"In spite of requesting almost everyday since 2 months, I have still not received a call from the Fraud Dept who is supposed to detect the fraud happening at Croma Borivali"
30,app,I was not informed that my coins was credited and its for short period. It expired without prior notice. I requested for refund but it did not happen. Very much unhappy and unsatisfied. 
30,app,"Worst first ever transaction , worst ever first interaction agent was not aware of the issue has to repeat multiple times, worst interface of the app, did not like it."
30,app,Even your app is not customer friendly.I could not pay my last order of bigbasket and had to pay cash on delivery 
30,app,Your customer support is pathetic they were not able to resolve the issue even after a month and I bought apple Ipad air on reliance digital after waiting for a month 
30,app,"Your executive was good, but overall app experience is poor, too heavy to navigate, takes time to load, gives blank screen at times during transition and payment speed is poor "
30,app,Such a poor customer service that deleted the app and closed my Neu account. Full of inefficient executives.
30,app,Executive was supportive. But the application is not upto the mark.
30,app,"Good in knowledge and attitude, hopeless in resolution. Tata New messed up my order like nobody has done before. The customer care executives had no clue to how to cancel the order, there in no option on the app and the customer care did not respond to my mail to cancel the order. Simply awelful!"
30,app,I had ordered groceries which did note deliver on time. Customer care told me it is out for delivery and will reach within 30 minutes. Which never happened and i had to ultimately cancel the order the next day. 
30,app,Since days I have been waiting  for solution but nothing is happening. At all stages I raised an issue but no solution. I was not expecting such response from Tata company 
30,app,i just wanted to mail my invoice which was not getting generated form app. and even after contacting executive twice i didnt get my invoice
30,app,Placed orders are got canceled by itself .. many times approximately 6 times and no any satisfactory answer are given by anyone 
30,app,"Good customer service, I'm satisfied wid the answers. I understood the concept of newcoin after dat i placed an order of 16200 n as per ur promise I got 810 neucoins, it's amazing, app is amazing it's new and exciting, overall I liked the idea & concept of tata, it was my 1st experience on tata neu & it was great. Good going. Ty."
30,app,required lots of improve your app
30,app,"Your customer care executive is looking the order#TC300030608681 status in the application & provide me the details. I can very well see it. However, my issue was need to know why the above mentioned order was not delivered on time & why people are not updating? Due to this reason Amazon is doing better business than TATA. Why can't I rely on TATA...area of improvements are as follows:
1. Team should update order status on time
2. Customer care executive should be provided detailed information about logistic part
3. They should have ability to connect with internal team to know real cause of the issue
4. Your customer relationship manager must review each & call to know what is happening at ground level
5. TCS should upgarde their software according to business requirements must provide escalation matrix in the NEU apps"
30,app,Please improve your mobile app
30,app,Third class service . I told him I want log in my old account . He told it will take 1 week after 1 week he told me your problem resolved . But when I check same issue happening again .. very disconnected with service 
30,app,The application is very slow n service is also not efficient
30,app,"Jab se neu lauch Hua he tabase har chiz jo iss application se ho sakti he vo sab me neu se hi try karta Hu. Kyun ki ye TATA ki application he. But Kahi bar problems aate he. Flipkart, amazon or paytm low network me bhi jitne achchhe se load hote he Itne achchhe se neu nahi Hota ne. Iske alava application background bhi it itna effective nahi he ise or better banaya ja sakta he .. dusre application se compare karke aap NEU ko or better Bana sakte he.. "
30,app,Still i hv not recieved the invoice copy for my OnePlus 10pro purchase. The app is cumbersome and pathetic to even simply generate a invoice .
30,app,"Tata Neu is a great app but it will become superapp when it runs superfast speed. I am telling that because the app does not run smoothly.  
In electronics section, sometimes it runs good not very good but sometimes not. Sometimes entrie app goes on slow mode. I have been feeling laggy experience on Tata Neu. To compete with e-commerce giant , Tata nue will have to be smooth, lag free. 

My review on invoice :- I have not found any option in ordered section of the app where I can download my invoice of my product. The invoice which I gave got from Tata Neu is not in any downloadable format eg:- PDF or word etc. So I hope, In the next update  
I can see invoice features and lag free experience.
    ""Tata Neu the app for every Indian.""
     ""Tataâ™¥ï¸the brand of every Indian.""
                   Thank you!
               
"
30,app,Very bad experience with app 
30,app,My real query was not resolved since the CC Exec didnâ€™t have an answer as to why prices/offers/discounts of items would be diff on TataNeu app & bigbasket app although both are under the Tata brand
30,app,app not working properly 
30,app,Your CC executives appear to have a lot of time or lack basic intelligence. A call to them means at least an hour is wasted with no resolution of the issue.
30,app,"You might have most competitive price of product but your android app is horrible, are you really owner of TCS!

Your package department don't know how to hand over parcel to courier service.

Overall purchase experience is worst."
30,app,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
30,app,Never experienced a worse support. Your approach to solving a problem is not to acknowledge it. So better learn how to render support and then send people feedback requests!
30,app,"Their must be an option to change some small changes in adress after placing the order, like until 2 hours after placing the order,and please update the tataneu application which was so slow "
30,app,Your app is pathetic. It showed option for cancellation but when I tried cancelling it stopped showing my order details. It was crashing all the time. App asked me to contact customer care. While customer care guys couldn't fetch my order details. Finally the app stopped showing the electronics order section altogether. It was really a frustrating experience. I had called multiple times but no one could help me out. 
30,app,Worst app ever and worst customer guidance.i will never use and recommend this bullshit to anyone. Becouse after using this people will get frustrated 
30,app,i didn't get the appropriate answer 
30,app,"My query is still pending, the electronic section of the app is closed and I can't return the faulty product received. "
30,app,Very disappointed and frustrated and I donâ€™t think iâ€™ll again shoping with tata neu and never suggest to any friends 
30,app,"There is no proper response from website and mobile app, showing lot of offers but its not allowing to buy the product, this is not good for your new journey in ecommerce area, please take responsibility, it was damaging our TCS Brand. "
30,app,Worst experience with neu app and croma.com
30,app,"Please make the tata neu app hassle free, whenever I try to check my order details and return details, it crashes again and again. "
30,app,The app need a lot improvement and customer service is good
30,app,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
30,app,Worst experience with app and customer care
30,app,"The app is not working , nor is the customer care aware abt anything"
30,app,I chased for my refund for more than 2 months and I gave up. I am no more interested in pursuing for my refund. Very very disappointed with Tata Neu.
30,app,I am very happy 
30,app,Only suggeston that there must be option available in he app to raise concerns on the delivered supplies. It is irritating to go to chat box or email route. Because it is inconvinient to link order no etc from outside the app.
30,app,Happy with all teams 
30,app,Never seen a worst customer service in my life ... 2months now my money is not refunded .. no call communication from them... If I call them all they say is wait for another 73hrs... Like that it's 2month now ... I won't use this app nor suggest anyone to use this fraud app either
30,app,I am absolutely appalled that you sent me this survey after complaining about your service on social media .. you guys are from some other planet !! No way Iâ€™m recommending you to even my sworn enemy .. thatâ€™s how badly ineligible you guys are in my view !! 
30,app,Very bad experience Mere pass big basket app nahi hai ab tata neu ko bi delete kar diya
30,app,You app is pathetic and your customer care agents are also pathetic. They ask a question and ghost customers. No response to the query at all
30,app,"Polite knowledgeable and Professional executive, resolved my query within few minutes, very happy customer "
30,app,"For a offer related issue which lasts only a few days, it's really disappointing that you take about a month's time to respond"
30,app,"Thank you for quick resolution of my issue. But I think integration between other tata apps and tata neu needs improvement. Sometimes big basket, tata play or 1mg doesn't open from Tata Neu though these work properly from individual apps. "
30,app,Beautiful app
30,app,"Response was very slow
No clarity about my problem
Response was similar to that available in application
More mature response was expected "
30,app,team work is appreciated.
30,app,Totally unhappy as i was refused to give a replacement for a product which has faulty manufacturing.  Very sad with the most unhelpful approach and was asked to go without a replacement. Will never buy products from Tata Outlets in future. 
30,app,I was not allowed to explain the issue clearly and 2-3 calls and emails from the customer support team explaining what they think the issue was and the best part was no resolution except saying try JustPay which i have no clue what is it...Anyways stopped using Tata Neu unless i am forced to and using other apps which are quite smooth...Listen to the customer first rather than trying to be oversmart...
30,app,"My issue is not resolved. It does not fall in the scope of customer service agent. It is technical, where your app is malfunctioning. Even today. "
30,app,Pathetic experience. Will not try to use this app and waste my time going forward 
30,app,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily
30,app,Frod app
30,app,"I am buy OnePlus nord ce2 but Teta Neu provide OnePlus nord ce2 lite.... I had 7,000 loss and also complaint raised but 2 days is going issue still is pending not answering tata neu and croma. I am purches first time with tata neu, i had very bad experience and don't suggest and one to use this app.. Be alert...."
30,app,Very poor service by Tata...they showed on neu that I'll get mobile next day still not received nd the customer care will still call after 24hrs.If they tell I'll get the order after 2days what's the point in placing order on app.
30,app,"Cromartie executive didn't know the details of Tata Neu app,how customers would benefit from the app."
30,app,Customer care is ok but application problem booking not confirmed account deduction 
30,app,"NEU is a thrash app keeps failing/crashing all the time and the reason provided for payment failure for which I reached out was time out, however when I used it directly on the BB app it worked flawlessly. "
30,app,"Please help me understand that how the TataNeu app deducted the TataNeu Coins instantly, and at same time get a message that order has not been confirmed since payment failed. And I had to pay again where different amount got deducted. "
30,app,"Need to improve withbyour app price. It should not change any time. Customer check the price and book the product. And you chanhe the price anytime. Which is very bad.
I use many apps for grocery but none of the apo change the price after buying the product."
30,app,She left the conversation between and not responded for more then 15 minutes then I closed the chat. Very unhappy of the service.
30,app,"I placed my order from CROMA only because the product was not showing on the TATA NEU APP, but the points credited to me were 0.33% instead of 5% (as claimed by TATA NEU) even though croma being a TATA company. No where was it mentioned that the purchase has to be made with tata neu app, and nowhere it was mentioned that croma will give only 0.33% neu coins. Its disappointing and unacceptable. "
30,app,"""Request you no need to worry a delivery guarantee will get credit in bb wallet once the order delivered end of the day and we will take a complaint regarding the same so that next time it will not happen hence request to please bear us for this time."" 
I was told that delivery guarantee would be credited to my bb account after the delivery but I haven't received any such thing."
30,app,"The customer care was not able to understand the question 
Simply when asked about product installation 
They don't have any idea when product installation will happen
Product installation needs to be completed within 24 hrs, TATA needs to improve ON THIS"
30,app,"I asked why is the app not working. We are ordering, the products donâ€™t get delivered and then after some time we are asked to cancel ourselves. Poor experience!!"
30,app,I registered my complain on Tata new app .. Customer care executive call me everyday but .. service of repairing taken almost 5-7 days ..service conducted but problem still running ... no solution at all.. service man just advised us unnecessary things how to use . but problem still remains ... no solution at all.. very poor service from Tata product Chroma.. not expected at all
30,app,Complete help to use promotional offers and payment options was not given like use of neu points not possible with retry payment option. The chat app experience was  on slow pace. However I appreciate the executive presence. 
30,app,"There was no resolution to my query. The customer executive stated it was a technical glitch due to which my order 122371107 was showing as ""payment timeout"" despite my credit card having been debited for the said amount. I was told I would get a refund, but I would have preferred my order to have been delivered instead. The app doesn't seem to be working to satisfactory level and should not be placed in the public domain until the glitches are sorted. Very disappointed!"
30,app,"Tata neu app payment process is not proper ,this has happened two times earlier,
Particularly when we use payment by adjusting neu coins it is getting stuck and payment fails.pl look into this i could not get solution to this , ultimately i had to pay by agreeing to  cash on delivery without adjusting neu coins."
30,app,Even after my bankdebited my account your app was showing payment as pending.That is why Icancelled the order.Still waiting for refund
30,app,"You are not been abled to resolve my issue since almost two months.
Still can't buy using your app "
30,app,Happy to be with tata
30,app,"Not resolved, without my consent ticket resolved without addressing the issue. Very poor service. Completely disappointed."
30,app,Hopeless App. Agent cannot do much if the customer has a pathetic experience with the app. 
30,app,No issues with particular associate but not happy with overall policy of tataneu. Was supposed to get 5% coins but got only .33%
30,app,"Highly disappointed, the issue is handled with very casual approach, there is no seriousness in resolving the issue promptly."
30,app,"The TataNeu app is too slow, kindly improve the app, it needs to be much lighter & faster to operate on mobiles"
30,app,Worst application ever and worst support team
30,app,I think working of app is slow
30,app,Neo coins not getting credited on time and buffering within app
30,app,Same repeated issues and customer care representative have no adequate knowledge about the issues and Tata Neu overall app. The App has lots of bugs and there is no efforts either to understand or solve the issues. Very pathetic app   
30,app,Your client has done brilliant work....i appreciate ðŸ‘..... thankyou!
30,app,Poor service and actions not impressed with tata neu and the service that I received from croma specific. Very disappointed with such service. Other apps out there provide better experience and service. 
30,app,Good explanation I am happy 
30,app,"When I was ordering, date of delivery was showing as 29.10.2022. However later it was changed to 03.11.2022. Pathetic service I would say. I would have rather ordered from other e commerce app which were ready to deliver same day. "
30,app,Your tata neu application is very good interface but loading time taken too much time....and add more services  there....kindly follow flipkart amazon or best interface...so more customers can easily purchase sir...also pls expand your service to all the  main areas ....mainly your products are cheap rate...but customer can't purchase...because delivery service not available for many places...today all the customer need delivery for there home....then you can earn more profit...Till last 3 years i m trying to purchase from your company but can't ... We need delivery service here sir... kindly do the needful
30,app,I make 2 calls and 3 what's app chat for my own neu coin that's not fair your customer support is very slow I need compansation of extra neu coin bye
30,app,"Very good , I'm Happy"
30,app,"Please accept my gratitude. Thank you for being calm, patient , courteous & efficient. Fully satisfied ðŸ˜Š Happy & Proud to be a Tataneu customer . ðŸ™ "
30,app,She was very helpful and I appreciate her guidance
30,app,i was most satisfied with her positive approach in attending & solving my problem.
30,app,"Pathetic pathetic pathetic pathetic service by Tata Neu. My order was delivered on Wednesday and till Saturday Installation has not happened. I need compensation of Rs 5,000 for delay in installation. I have not received installation SMS also till today. Whereas other online company as well as Croma is also providing installation of electronic product in 24 hours. "
30,app,"Tata Neu app is slow in my phone. Otherwise, I just have positive feedback."
30,app,So disappointed service so slow
30,app,"Splendid service by the associate. Even though he could not resolve my issue due to technical glitches, was very empathetic and patient in listening to me.

Cheers and please pass on the appreciation to him."
30,app,I am not brought  a product chandrapur croma shop i am not purchase on line also pincode  not available in my home delivery  i am not happy no body can help me to solve the issue to bring me products  corma led 43 inch tv smart hd android  for 4 day i am unhappy  for this service  point 0 sir
30,app,I'm so happy 
30,app,Very unresponsive and laggy app
30,app,You guys really need to improve upon your mobile app. It is so slow and has so many bugs
30,app,"Customer care service is too fast my problem is solved in chat but they call me to sure that really my problem is solved or not . really a good customer service now i am a permanent user of tata app.

                                   Thanku sir/mam"
30,app,"Thanks for giving details knowledge.
We are very happy."
30,app,"For something as straightforward as my issue (credit of Neucoins for a purchase at Croma store for which the copy of Physical receipt was provided to Customer Care), the amount of time it took to resolve the issue, is preposterous. Secondly, even after the issue was apparently resolved, I kept getting emails (I got at least 3) that it will take another 48 hours for the issue to be resolved. The entire thing seems extremely disjointed "
30,app,Worst service by Tata neu app and Tata neu customer care service 
30,app,"My problem is solved, I am very happy with customer service "
30,app,I appreciate the executive quick responses and she provided me some extra information for better transperancy. I am really thankful. Keep it up. 
30,app,Very appreciative by the agent  he also provide all the information on mail that is very secure
30,app,Very happy with the service. hanks.
30,app,Utterly disappointed 
30,app,The executive was very good and gave me proper resulation appreciate the help good service
30,app,Naziya helped me in a good way.. Absolutely happy :) 10 â˜†
30,app,Overall good.happy with the service
30,app,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address..!!?? Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good."
30,app,No as discussed I m very happy to communication 
30,app,Ur app is the worst possible app in the world....
30,app,Thanks a lot for solving my issue within minutes. Much appreciated.
30,app,I was expecting for the resolution at the earliest and the team reached after 10 working days !!! Not acceptable at all hence uninstalled the app and wont be using at all here on 
30,app,Fake link was shared to everyone and told you that you won the price so install the app and that one is yours. Don't make customer fool. Thanks 
30,app,Awesome app
30,app,good service with quick response.happy with service 
30,app,Develop ur tata neu app which is running very slow
30,app,Very bad service i  am not happy 
30,app,"Neu coins were offered and when tried to encash it, not applied. After communicating for more than 45 minutes with costumer care, problem has not been resolved. Not expecting from TATA"
30,app,Customer care executive was brilliant but your system/app is faulty. I was unable to find my order details which I ordered 4-5 months before. And also executive was unable to find the same.. 
30,app,"Customer care cannot solve a single issue. Giving useless suggestion. Trashy app, trashy customer care "
30,app,"I hv tried to 2 times Add my card in Tata pay.Rs 4 was deducted but card still not added/ appearing.
I hv not selected TOKENIZATION.I thought it is optional.
But later your rep informed to also select Tokenization while adding card.
This should be clear on portal itself.
Pl refund my Rs4/-
"
30,app,"Customer support Bahut hi achha hai yaar aaplogo ka Matlab Main tata neu ke Whatsapp chat ke through Kisi bhi tata ke partner website jaise tata cliq, Croma, big basket,1mg se chat kar sakta hoon aur woh bhi 24hrs kabhi bhi. Matlab gajab ka customer support hai aaplogo ka "
30,app,I appriciate after sale services provided to me including the delvery of my order
30,app,Make mobile app little bit more smooth for batter and fast.
30,app,Make Tata Neu app faster. It lags way too much to be usable.
30,app,"Your customer care was on so much hurry to talk , she cut the call.
Not satisfied with answers which she gave.
Uninstalling this app. Thanks"
30,app,"Your app is too cumbersome and counter-intutive, please make your app easy to use by an average educated Indian through any language and any level of intelligence"
30,app,"The girl who spoke to me, i don't remember her name but she was polite provided accurate information about Tata Neo points. She is a asset to your Tata family... I would recommend a small promotion or salary increment to her so that she will be happy. 

Thanks
Gagan Ponnanna
"
30,app,Executive are helpful.But nevegateing your app is difficult 
30,app,Your Tata Neu is hopeless.They could not solve my problem .Finally Bigbasket daily executive advised to update the app through play store.I did it and problem is over.
30,app,"I'm happy wid d info, good customer service, n I got 1413 newcoins on my today's 1st order, so happy n excited, Thank u, Viren for info ðŸ‘ðŸ»"
30,app,I still have the issue. Unable to place order to Neu app
30,app,Improve packing & update your app for location and mapping issue.
30,app,"My order of apple charger was supposed to be delivered on 2nd which is not yet delivered, I have ordered another charger as Store pick up and I have got the charger but need to cancel the earlier one which is stuck since long. No one is able to get that order cancelled. Please get that order cancelled. Order placed on 2nd oct "
30,app,"First of all keep the app interface simple enough that it is easy to connect with support. The current interface has one big flaw, the current window gets reset everytime the customer switches tab. Trying to connect with the customer executive multiple times for a single issue is highly disconcerting."
30,app,40 rs not showing in app also I want to give fresh order but delivery schedule not showing n this is redicules
30,app,Kindly be very clear about your offers and make announcements on the app..If you dont read terms and conditions youll be fooled 
30,app,"I was given good amount of explanation on my query.  Although, I was not very satisfied after placing the order because I received a text message from Croma asking that the payment was not completed and they provided a new link for payment (also tata new app said product not processed until 1 day after purchase). I had purchased the product using Tata Neu App and no Cost EMI option. It is confusing for the customer and might end up paying twice for the product. After the call, I am assured that the product purchase is completed and it is in shipped status. Eagerly waiting for the product to get delivered. Thank You Team."
30,app,Your IT team which looks after the App should be well informed in advance about the offers available to the customers.  No non-existing offer should be appearing on the App.
30,app,"Please can you extend the order placement time of express delivery upto 10 pm.. It is upto 8 pm now. 
Kindly like to know that why no express delivery option in my tataneu app?.. It is available only in my Bigbasket app. "
30,app,Pathetic delivery/ lethargic status update/ service issues/ erratic app experience/ musical chairs of customer care executives. 
30,app,Please scrape your tata neu app. It is an awfully horrible app which never works.
30,app,No feedback as you people are idle to do support the customer. For the sake you will ask the feedback and finished. Nothing going to happen. But we customers can only do the review. That's it.
30,app,If your app comes with some offer then people should get benefit out of it and not get irritated by wasting their time for booking the items.and after fixing bugs app changes the offer.
30,app,"After raising the ticket, alomost ten members mailed me and o same message saying that - apologies and will look into it. After approximately 2 months resolution came with very lame reasons.
This is the worst customer service department I have come accorsa since 15 years I starting having experience ."
30,app,Worst experience and worst app I ever came across. Smallest of small companies handle better than your multi billion dollar company. Pathetic experience. I shouldn't have trusted and just gone through amazon. False promise of neucoins just to debit them after sometime with silly excuses.
30,app,I was struggling to get confirmation on my orders placed on Big Basket through the very slow Tata Neu App. My payments were debited & I did not get any invoice over email or app when I asked for it
30,app,I had to follow up with customer care team twice for my request and at the end I asked them to make me talk to their higher authority.But no one ever called back. The issue that I had raised is a genuine problem most customers will be facing and there is no solution to it as the app or the website doesn't support that option. Really bad experience.
30,app,I have been given tat of 72 hours but after 96 hours my query is still unresolved. Very bery very disappointing.
30,app,Super disappointed.
30,app,Disappointed
30,app,The customer care executives are poorly trained. I got a call from customer care about an issue i had raised previously regarding shortfall in neucoin credit for a recent purchase on croma which was made via tata neu app. But he had no idea about the issue. So why did he call me i don't understand. Then he said the issue will be resolved within 72 hours. But i already knew that. The experience is pathetic and the tata neu experiment is destined to fail. The neu app user experience is bad. I made the purchase via the tata neu app for which i am to receive 5% neucoins. However the app had a glitch and did not register the purchase!
30,app,"The issue is not at all resolved from day 1, customer service stopped replying....bigbasket not opening from tataneu Each agent gave completely opp answer about what happens to decimal points when we earn 5% neucoins"
30,app,I am going to delete your app in my phone
30,app,"Lengthy process in start. Seems they don't know to listen and only talk. And yes problem is not only with them. The issue is your app. You just launched your app to become the first one where person gets everything without proper testing it. Yes person gets here everything ie stress, confusion, anger. You guys should pay compensation to your customers to use your app."
30,app,"1. Again and again new person get involved without knowing the issue. 2. The minor issue of OTP is not resolved, infact i challenge they have neither tried nor understood the issue. There shd be a limit to cross carelessness. 3. If this what is happening with me for a issue like a peanut what others will be facing?"
30,app,No one give ri8 solution i reached on many platforms whats app chat call chat and all but did not get any solution
30,app,Custmarcare handlers are good but your loan department staf is dumb... My loan is approved although they awaited me for 10 days.. My e- mendet also done.. But aldhough they reject my pl after 10 days...
30,app,"My 5th order was cancelled even after order successful status. I cant believe why they have created this app if no one can order. Customer service is pathetic, they are not listening to customer and saying you will get refund and place again fresh order. This is unacceptable as i have already tried 5 times with different payment mode."
30,app,"actually without knowledge i entered the non registered number with bank account in the app. so by this mistake my processing were stopped so i contacted to customer service there replied in return that the problem will solve in 24hrs, so i wait for one day resolve but after one day the staff replied that their could not solve problem and make new account i did that also with same pan number ,now i'm not eligible for EMI LOAN . By this i could there loan some of the mistake lies on me but i expected that your staff will resolved but now i'm disappointed"
30,app,Feeling cheated and unhappy with the support
30,app,My request for change of email ID and phone number in my Neu app profile has not been done but has been announced as done.
30,app,None of one resolve my query so finally cancel the order My 1st experience with croma it's very disappointed
30,app,One of worst and shittiest customer service I lost nearly 5k and my issue was not resolved I don't use this app anymore
30,app,"Cannot find where to contact customer care executives on your app. I bought a fridge from Croma for over 1.5L, wanted to lodge a complaint for the fridge through Neu app but it was very complicated and i have not done so far."
30,app,"There is a fraud happening where the customers NeuCoins are deducted even though the customer had not cancelled any order. I have asked every agent to connect me to the Fraud Department, but I am yet to hear from the Fraud Team. It is frustrating to repeat the issue to a new agent everyday."
30,app,Disappointed on the Neu Coins reward on my current stay
30,app,I am happy
30,app,"The app has problem and they were giving ""robotic"" reply!"
30,app,I would have appreciated if I could contact doc the same day but for some reason it was not happening. The agent though was very helpful and listened to me.
30,app,the CS app is worst. It didn't even show chat and the CS closes the chat.
30,app,It took them over 2 weeks just to inform me that a Covid RT-PCR test through Tata 1mg app does not contribute towards Tata Neu Coins. Expect better from such a reputed company.
30,app,Your app is very disappointed. So many issues
30,app,One of the wrost app experience I have ever seen
30,app,"There is an issue in using Amex carp on tata neu app, this needs to be resolved."
30,app,I am cotinue in with your customer care from last three days about my query and also in touch with your employees who called me for documentation. Everyday they only giving me time for 24 hours. But still i didn't get my solution . If it is not possible then clear me . I have lots of option . Why are you wasting my time If i didn't get loan on time then after what is value for me . If you can disburse it time then well other wise refuse it I will take in 10 min from other sources there are lots company there who provide it quikly. Now i totally disappointed from your end Please help if you can other wise leave it
30,app,"I am applying the loan 13th june... Still not received loan amount... I informed customer care,but no one responded to solve the problem"
30,app,One of the wrost applications I have seen
30,app,Very disappointing customer care and delivery of item is delayed from the promised time very pathetic service i will prefer amazon or flipkart before yours service i will never order and item from you just give me what i had ordered on time
30,app,Unable to complete payment on the app for 2 weeks. Was ok today.
30,app,Firstly my order did not reflect at all thereby making it difficult even for the Customer Care to identify it. Secondly I didnâ€™t think it would have taken so long to sort it as I was looking to gift it to my Mother. Not only could I not achieve it I on the contrary was waiting endlessly to get a resolution. Very unhappy.
30,app,It was good befire 2-3 minth back Support is Detroited.. Not good experience and dnot at all good integration with other app.. Neu coin discrepancy is always there
30,app,"However, the bills paid in the Taj Hotels bars after discounts during happy hours do not qualify for Tata Neu points. This must be rectified."
30,app,"Tried booking Airticket, I was disappointed, asI could not book it. Tried booking medicines, disappointed."
30,app,"First of all this TATA NEU app is most bogus and worthless app I ever used and your CC Executives are ineligible persons who can only say Sir please wait for 1 day, 48 hrs & atlast 72 hrs. but unable to solve the problem"
30,app,I have a emergency so ill applied personal loan in tata neu app and ill get sanction letter on Sunday received but the money is not cerited to my account im very very worried for your process
30,app,Qik card is approved but not able to use.
30,app,There is a fraud happening with NeuCoins being stolen from the customers
30,app,"Thank you very much. I've never seen a team so supportive and helpful to fix a problem. Literally you guys gave me update on situation every 2 days and worked hard to fix it. A company with immense passionate and hardworking team, hands down it's the best. I will continue submit error reports if I find any to help improve the app. Again, Thanks a lot."
30,app,Very good service.tata neu is best app for shopping and upi

30,app,I find that the neu app is slightly sluggish. It is not very user friendly.
30,app,Please complete loan application and transfer money today
30,app,It took over three months and multiple mails and calls to get an issue resolved - and the issue pertained to something that should have happened automatically.
30,app,Happy with the way our reservation done at this resort . Keep up the good work of entertaining the society.
30,app,"The point on which a major improvement needed is that, the customer should be always aware of the status of their order, which currently is very broadly provided not the detailed one. Also for any complaint status. One should be always informed either by some message or email or the status on the app that so and so complaint is being lodged and this is the status of it."
30,app,My issue has not been resolved even after 5 days. I was cheated out of 5% neucoins for purchase made at croma on tata neu app. Even after talking to customer care on 2 ocassions the issue not resolved. Terrible experience overall
30,app,"The Resolution I was provided with , I am not happy with that"
30,app,Very very bad ?... Totally disappointed qik loan service. Not properly
30,app,"I have tried to get the loan amount done and gone through the online documentation process. Unfortunately, it was ended with error during the last moment and when I was in need tried the same after some days this time it took longer then expected disbursal time post issuing the sanction letter and finally it got rejected thatâ€™s what the last update post creating the hope for me. Extremely disappointed."
30,app,After applied and approval i was waiting for more than 10 days and finally KYC Decline due to not received after date given by customer care person. and finally after 10days disbursal of an approved amount not credited and decline the same. Thanks
30,app,Not happy
30,app,"Have been chasing customer care since 3 months now, still I am. It sure if they are able to understand my problem. Every time they give same explanation that my query has been forwarded to backend team and they are looking into it. I had asked for escalation matrix, but haven't received despite multiple requests. It's extremely disappointing."
30,app,Its very very bad customer care. Noone giving information which i don't know and giving information which i show and showing in app
30,app,This app should be forced to shut down.
30,app,They won't listen customer preferences and there is no communication regarding customer requests. I extremely disappointed we missed installation on my cousin birthday. I didn't expect from Tata brand â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸
30,app,I was told that I will receive 12rs credit in my bb Wallet for the return of items from my recent order. But I didnt receive any .. And it's been 1week. It's disappointing
30,app,"On 25-jun I had asked for initiating a return/replacement request since the product did not have a powerOn button feature which I desparately needed. The executive created an SR 25062201371 for the same. However instead of processing the return/replacement, my SR was forwarded to technician who promptly closed the ticket saying that there is no defect. When i called again today i was told that return/replacement can happen only if the product had a defect. And asked me to visit the store to get the product returned."
30,app,"Many times, there is no response or no solution. This app is only for advertising offers, not for forwarding customers."
30,app,"Customer care rep was not bothered about solving the issue , they just wanted to close the ticket and move on. Very disappointing experience"
30,app,First your company gave me a sanction letter and then next day they said loan didnt approve and no one in your customer care knows d reason
30,app,Not happy with resolution
30,app,This is frustrating when you approve a limit and we are getting payment failed. Worst first time experience with tata Neu Pathetic service.
30,app,Customer care executive doesn't have knowledge to resolve my query. I am very much dis-satisfied with Tata neu. I don't recommend using this app.
30,app,I don't recommend using tata neu app. Customer service is too bad.
30,app,I had reached out to help centre with a query regards to BB billing. I had incorrectly put in a wrong CVV No. & hence my payment failed. i was keen to pay prior to delivery by Credit card instead of COD & wanted to clarify if that was possible by way of a new payment link . The response on the message service was slow. wait time to connect was acceptable ( within a minute ) but therefafter responses to the two & froo conversation was very slow. I felt the agent had put me on hold ( although possibly he was checking my billing) . Also my query was not suitably responded & the agent disconnected without taking my approval. I had to reach out again to another agent the 2nd agent suitably addressed my query. Recommendation : the agent should explicitly wait for a confirmation from the customer whether he has any other queries before disconnecting. Also why cant a customer make payment again by CC online if the first attempt has failed ?
30,app,"So many features is missing in Neu app. No direct access to chat menu. CCE takes so much time to reply, for any kind of query they are same repetative answers."
30,app,Neu app has so many glitches and there is no option to cancel your order or change the delivery address.
30,app,my issue was left unresolved. the wait time is too much. the issue of failure of transctin though your app or web page remainds unresloved
30,app,"Very delayed response and if the cult app is included in TATA Neu, all the information about it should be available to customer care to support the customer."
30,app,Your Senior lead manager have no value of their words. Mr Nikhil assure to resolve the issue of BSNL pre paid 15 days ago nothing has happepend till now . niether responded nor he resolved the issuse .
30,app,"My query was about NeuCoins which can be redeemed only after 11-7-2022. However, this earned NeuCoins was not reflecting in the application. Hence my query on the same. Request application to show all NeuCoins earned including locked one. Executive informed that same will be reflected from 11-07-2022. Application can have total NeuCoins earned, locked NeuCoins, and redeemable NeuCoins."
30,app,Fraud app
30,app,Please complete loan application. Please bank transfer
30,app,Customer executive has very little knowledge about the query .she is accepting that there is some problem in the app but when will it be resolved or will there be no problem to customer because of it in future she has no answer for that. even after that I am facing the problem but i decided not to raise it again I know there is no point in wasting time and energy as you will be replied with same scripted answers ..but very bad customer handling..
30,app,Not worth ordering on app... Order food at 12.20 pm and food received at 2.45pm and while booking the delivery was confirmed between 1.30 to 2pm. No options for tracking and contacting customer care. Horrible experience
30,app,Really disappointed with food delivery. Will never order
30,app,Very long time but finany my amount my bank account credit So thank you Tata app I am again purchase your app Again thank you so much
30,app,It appears from the emails from customer service that the problem has not been understood or is not being admitted.
30,app,"According Croma sales man I spend through your app, but no points indication is there"
30,app,My query is not resolved for the second time n the ticket was closed! I just highlighted a bug in ur application handling d exchange orders! If u r nt able to handle such exchange transactions donâ€™t provide those facilities! Closing the ticket without resolution wonâ€™t help either u r me! This s so disappointing customer service from TATA!
30,app,It is totally disappointment. They go on asking same question even after reply
30,app,Tata Neu app is a good initiative & offers great benifits to customer. Moreover it is very user friendly.
30,app,Not at all resolved and at the top of it i will NEVER EVER recommend anyone to install this app as i have also uninstalled it !
30,app,"Hi Team My latest 3-4 transactions had horrible experiences. Hotel Stay Neu points took more than 45 days to reflect . Tata play app payment or recharge fails . Most of the time transaction fails . Needs better UI apps integration, customer support need to be proactive ."
30,app,MY refund query was replied stating that I will receive it in TataNeu app wallet but I cannot find any wallet anywhere. Appreciate if someone can call and clarify again. Also my two mobile number possible merging concept was not known to executive and still not clarified
30,app,Thank you for your hard work and care. Human errors keep happening. Just work harder next time. No worries!
30,app,I am not able to change my name and surname. Changing name and surname in this app is like very difficult.
30,app,I was applied for personal loan on 23 june and my disbursement date was 26 june and till date i didn't get my sanction letter since last 5 days i just got only 1 massage it is under process. Worst service i had ever seen from company like TATA.
30,app,Sorry to say no one has called me nor have replied to my query. Contacting and communication was easy with Taj Inner Circle group earlier. Tata Neu app is horrible and cannot resolve or refer to specific questions .
30,app,"Please fix the technical problems of your application and same time please direct your representatives to lodge complaint/ticket don't skip because it's misleads customer and delay the issue resolution. Which leads to confusion, mistrust. Go ahead with my case and extract the lesson to be learnt."
30,app,Its a very interesting app. Its a very good experience talking with the executive from customer service

30,app,"There has been lot gap /confusion in terms of how to earn neu coins.

30,app,my suggestion is that all purchases and payments made using the app should be emailed to the customer. when i make utility bill payments from amazon pay i always get a receipt or confirmation of payment. this feature is missing on your app and it is necessary for record purposes. kindly implement the same. thank you and best wishes to the TATA family.
30,app,All wrong commitment happening in between call centre team know one has proper answer one will say you will get NEU coins if you purchase only with croma in offline transaction some one will say you will after 14days of transaction system generated message will say due to technical error you didn't receive it will credit in you ur account with 72hrs why you suffering these much to customers I don't know am very much unhappy with your service there is chance to credit the NEU coins but know one least bother about customer service every one is saying we have changed our process from 31st March to whom you have given intimated why your making me suffer..
30,app,App provide features to refer a friend but when my friend was trying to login then there was no option to login via reffere code. Customer care told me this feature will be stopped after 7th april that why you are facing this issue but my concern is why there is an option to refer a friend if we cannot use it . Any change in app should go after validation each point.
30,app,The app is misleading.
30,app,Today date is 7. You should have opened the app now or shared referral code. Expecting a tata brand i sent my mail. Looks like it's not. Thanks. I may not refer.
30,app,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store

30,app,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
30,app,Your Mr Zameer does not understand what the issue is and just send stock replies â€¦ very disappointed and poor service
30,app,The app is just built to fool people. There are absolutely no processes in place and no defined SLA's or TAT's for getting queries resolved
30,app,The app is not working properly. There are lot of bugs in the app. The issue I have raised is still not resolved. As a TATA employee I recommended this app to download and many are having issues. There will be issues but resolving it on time will help people to download and use this app
30,app,Nice app and long way to go
30,app,Nice app Some modifications required like profile must be editable by consumer
30,app,"I will recommend because i have faith in TATA If product is not available on your App. People will go here and there , you are competing Amazon , I have a suggestion please add local shopkeepers on this app like amazon and you will see the best result with in a month, If not then customer eill find 1 time 2time on your app thats it , if product still out of stoct , then we have to buy from Amazon. Please think about it"
30,app,I am trying to return product by past 4 days and no response. Very big mistake to even download this app
30,app,Very poor service..i am book a flight ticket delhi to new york but neu app show me no flight details
30,app,I had referred one friend but not get neu coin worst application useless services
30,app,Very good service of new Tata app.
30,app,Features design for tata nue app during tata employees trials are not properly implemented. Payment features of cc registered in Tata nue should not allow to to do payment from big basket is earlier tnc are not followed to get nuecoins.
30,app,In market better app like Google pay and paytym. They giving much more reward than tataneu. Disappointed with tataneu. Not recommended
30,app,Your app is most unstable at the momment ...shouldn't have been launched in haste . Ensure stabilization at the earliest ...not using or recommending till than ...We really had painful experience
30,app,Bad services by tata neu app
30,app,Regarding the app - The ticket is in resolved status but no option to reopen as I still have queries Regarding customer care - again they have not addressed how my corporate benefits can be used on app as I know TCS employees are part of Tata group and get discount on most products on NEU so my question was how to use and response was no offers which is surely false ?
30,app,Issue not resolved. Tataneu is worst. Torture app.
30,app,This is bad you should give 5% neu coins when u buy in other tata apps and not restricted to tata neu app
30,app,DUE TO THE APP BITH DATE ENTERING PROBLEM MY BIRTH DATE WAS ENTERED WRONGLY WHEN I TRIED TO CORRECT it the messsage came contact customer care when i contacted customer care insteead of correcting he was asking like a gove office id proof for noirth date correction. i am disatisfied wit your app the UInetrface and your customer care regards Chacko mathew K 9349808994
30,app,Application of Neu Reqards Points to the Payment and your payment system is not working properly ...Fix it at earliest otherwise whole idea of Super App will Fail .....My Neu Grocery order ( BB) and for Medicines (1MG ) ..Payment Failed ( which never happened earlier ) ...and BB order got converted to COD ......and I paid Cash today ...So Fix the Problem
30,app,After I explained my reason of contacting support which is to know why I didn't get any new coins for any of the order placed in BigBasket this month. The support person asked for 2 min time to check the records and then disappeared forever and never responded to my follow up messages. I've noticed this behavior yesterday and today on all the chat sessions I initiated in hopes to get a reason .
30,app,They should have read and need to answer related to that. Lot of Bill services not available. Disappointed about app. It is very very Basic app
30,app,I satisfy with customer service representative but the delivery service not available in our area so not happy that much..
30,app,Your app migration is failure.
30,app,"Very bad experience , no quality check happening , same expiry date products are sent multiple times."
30,app,This is a good app for tata neu so and i will be a good service for tata neu app.
30,app,"Though yet to resolve, so far really happy with the swiftness /promptness on response and follow up from customer service team."
30,app,1st of all the app needs huge performance improvements. It is very slow. 2nd I had 500 neu coins when I tried to use it that time it did not happen and finally when I had thr option to use it then you guys are saying it had expired.
30,app,"Neither any of your representative talked to me nor I received any reply on my feedback and query. 2. I have lot of respect for the TATA brand and a loyal customer of its product for last 38 years. I had given feedback based on my experience in using this app. a) it seems you have integrated existing apps using APIs. During data migration you should have migrated card data also. b) while using BigBasket through Neu, it asked for my card details again and after adding the card and tapped the â€˜ continueâ€™ button, screen froze and did not respond. c)Then I came back to Home Screen by abandoning payment and went to make payment through â€˜accounts>orderâ€™ screen. Here als continue button didnâ€™t respond. d) in a number of screens back buttons are responding after three/four taps. It appears proper UAT hasnâ€™t been done. I request you to look into these deficiencies. 3. My QUERY IS: I use one mobile number for shopping and another one for banking. How can I register myself for TATA PAY. With Regards,"
30,app,"Totally disappointed. If it was not Tata I would have thought you guys have started a new fraud. Akshay, the teleresponder, lacks knowledge and does not have any quality to interact with customer. just listen to the recording of conversation."
30,app,I don't have referral option in my app
30,app,"Sent e mail only, no interaction with the representative. Hence 1 & 2 are not applicable"
30,app,"I want to suggest you make your app more user friendly and also add the service of ola , uber and IRCTC to book train ticket . You can also add a chat box where user can chat in with the person and from Their only they can direct send money. And for entertainment add your tata play or tata bing."
30,app,I had issues for edit name which automatically wrongly taken from app
30,app,"I checked out my order from the tata 1mg store on tata neu. the app tells me that the payment has failed , the bank has sent me the msg that my credit card has been debited. All I have been told by customer service is that if amount has been debited it will be reversed - but the main point is that tata neu is sending me notifications that the payment has failed. I have also shared the screenshot of the debit notification received from icici bank"
30,app,Am myself going to uninstall this app from my phone. Pathetic service and response.
30,app,The customer care executive is lacking product awareness. My query was that I am unable to find any option for recharging prepaid mobile through UPI. Only option available during checkout is debit / credit card. Her reply was The mobile recharge for prepaid is not available. We are working on that. All in all an undercooked app and an even more undercooked support team. Pathetic. So poor that even my emails and feedback were left unanswered. Very very poor from such a big company Tata
30,app,Highly impressed with the app. Integrate other Tata apps like Star Mart also .
30,app,I refered Tata neu to friends and one have registered using my referral code. I felt sorry to him for recommending this app and have requested to uninstall Tata neu like me.
30,app,Poor app
30,app,I can only recommend when I feel the app more user-friendly. Many more changes needed.
30,app,"everyone is taking lot of time to give proper response, what is the point of time to order online when you need to chat with customer service team for an hour if some thing goes wrong(thats what happens"
30,app,happy
30,app,faster your app servers
30,app,"took significant time to process the order, checkout and payment gateway. seems to be technical glitch in app. i tried 10 times to check-out but the time slot tab was not functioning."
30,app,V good I'm fully happy
30,app,"Grocery part is not accessible, app gets hanged in the case of clicking Grocery. For some other items also App gets hanged. Secondly I am having 2 Accounts of Tata 1 mg and I have been operating the one with Mobile No. 9981491770. (Email id daudchoudhary@gmail.com. I want this account be merged with Tata Neu App with Mobile No. 9424442773 (email id -daudchoudhary@yahoo.com), but somehow it is not getting done. Earlier also I requested to chnage my mobile no. From 9981491770 to 9424442773, but I was informed it is not possible. If it isnot possible, atleast transfer all my Orders and Prescriptions to the Account with Mobile No.9424442773, for records."
30,app,Slow non responsive app
30,app,"The response from your Customer Service was excellent, very quick, and, to the point! However, it is too early to judge your App. I was trying to pay subscription for my DTH Service. The app failed to recognise my Customer Number. I, however, could complete the transaction by scanning the QR Code. Right now, I am trying to open the app and want to make some purchase and pay for my phone bill. The app is hanging. Apparently, your server is too small to take the load of the users at one point of time. I am trying since last half an hour, without any luck. Best wishes! Binay Dutta"
30,app,"My Middle name is Ranjan but unfortunately your customer service told me only three letter allowed. Kaise app design kiyo bhai ek midle name bhi nahi ho pata apke side me . Jiska middle name he wo kya karega.... sirf fist or last name likhega? Bhai aur kya apko pan, adhaar au bank statement dena padega..... bhai au bhi app hai........"
30,app,"He was not ready to take the complaint w r.t to Tata 1mg cash which disappeared and I didn't got Neucash, instead he was like send a email. Which I found he should had done it"
30,app,First experience of this new payment is very worst. First payment itself failed and I need to wait for 7 days to get the amount back. Luckily I spent 500 rs . Just consider if i ordered 30000 product and payment got failed then I need to wait for 7 days to get back 30k and order it again. If again failed then again 7 days need to wait. Is this quality of application?
30,app,"I have done my mobile bill payment on 27th March,2022 due to some issues transaction got failed but amount got deducted which not yet received to me after 12+ days. Still executive saying they are looking for it. Whenever I approach them by app's chat."
30,app,"Nothing is resolved at all. If I am mot able to use UPI, this app is worthless for me and only capture space on my phone."
30,app,"It's, amazing & intrested in new tata neu app i would suggest : 1. Fast opening app need becoz icon image taking 5 sec 2. Fastest transactions in one second with more options 3. Background to be white so it reach out more more 4. In ads show it features like ( fastest transactions, booking tickets etc.. ) so it will be use youth very fastly , if youth uses whole country will reach out it I support this app , it new i understand it's take time ? your services ,response team always good â˜ºï¸"
30,app,"I understand the product will involve as time goes and I don't have any concern with the UI or how smoothly the app integrates with other apps owned by Tata but while doing payments through the app, the payment page kept loading and nothing happened. I spent at least an hour to complete my payment and still unable to do so even after taking help from customer service. Finally, I completed my payment through Bigbasket app. I really don't understand, how hard it is for a product to pull payment details from the gateway. I was so disappointed."
30,app,"the issue was , why electricity bill was not paid when the money already debit from my debit card.... well as per tata neu, i will get refund in next 5 days.... lets see... and what about the payments.... if for the payment i have to switch to amazon as it clearly shows that tata neu app is not able to paying the bill then why i need tata neu app?"
30,app,The time taken in chat was high. Also making my first BSNL bill payment did not earn me any benefit. So disappointed.
30,app,"My order no ws892171990 not yet delivered and do not know the status also. Kindly look in to my concern. This is new app, i don't want to blame at this moment, hope should be better in future. Please improve upon. Dixit 9963290066"
30,app,The app is half cooked and there has been a rush in requesting us to download it . Call Center employees are taking the brunt of the poor management decision. my first 2 orders have gone for a toss .
30,app,Never get any solutions to issues raised. Just receive auto emailers. high problems of integrations in the app
30,app,"My issue with pending refund has not been resolved. The customer care is always eager to close the complaint tickets without providing resolution or making any progress on the issue. The whole experience of repeated reminders, requests and calls is harrowing to say the least. Extremely disappointed."
30,app,I'm unable to find more information about your app through representative.
30,app,You app not good
30,app,No resolution for my query has been answered. The ticket has been closed automatically without any resolution and response. Everytime I ask for an update you guys give me a new ticket id but no resolution is happening on any of those tickets. Totally useless customer support service this is
30,app,Thanks to customer care suggestion reinstall for transection issue. UPI registration is blocked for today I can't do transection through this app for entire day.
30,app,Its very worst for me In app u showing 5% neucoin but when we use and purchased from app than u are not giving it. Also ur customer care number continually showing switche off. Very very bad experience
30,app,"There was no solution with customer care about the customer problem. How application is picking customer name without customer consent. Now for change, you are asking valid proof. Please correct."
30,app,"Please improve the total app,. UPI ACCESS REQUIRED URGENT"
30,app,Thank you to tata and tata neu i am so much happy i am reffering to my all friend
30,app,Add neu coins on UPI payments also and also give some reward when I refer to my friends.other wise app is good.
30,app,Concept of tata neu is very good. But I think app some time lag. So please solve this issue. I request big busket products available all over India.
30,app,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
30,app,It seems the app is still not working as expected. The development team has to debug the app. Experience is not good so far.
30,app,The app isn't even usable as the app needs to be fully operational and all the basic bugs should be removed immediately.
30,app,CSR just disappeared without solving issue. :(
30,app,Thank you for help and thank you TATA Nue Team for such wonderful application
30,app,Very nice and setisfide for calling for coustomer care tata new app best for loan and upi
30,app,I was told to uninstall and reinstall the app. I made payment for Tata Play but canâ€™t buy anything after reinstalling. Installing/un installing or switching on/off is normal first aid if any system is malfunctioning or not working. The app needs to be smooth in all respects in the era of competition.
30,app,"My issue didn't get resolved, I didn't get it what I ask for. The customer service representative was telling to logout and login, or reinstall the app will solve."
30,app,Customers support good but not best. Tata if u competition then do much better app and customer service
30,app,Very good growing tata. I wish tata neu next revulation app in india for better future
30,app,Hello Sir I am unable to do my transactions by UPI mode it is not showing UPI mode option while doing transaction there is only one option showing of cards Payment mode. The UPI I'd has successfully registered and I can check my account balance also but still can't do transactions throughout UPI payment mode. I have also raised the complaint regarding this issue but still it has been not solved I has been showing pending. Please solve this issue as soon as possible or else I have to uninstall tata neu app. Thank You
30,app,Good app and good customer service
30,app,"Good, improve the app"
30,app,Three is no any offers to paying bills. And all companies applications are giving discount. But compare to all companies tata is a big company but no use at all I thing so. Sorry to say this type of answers. I strongly will not recommend to anyone in this society sorry to say this once again.
30,app,"Customer service executive was good. But, abruptly cut the call. However the issue is with NeuCoins. Itâ€™s advertised as 5% across the app but has hidden terms and conditions. Thatâ€™s misleading"
30,app,Great service. All the best for the app's success. Needs such good representatives.
30,app,Very convenient and user friendly app
30,app,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
30,app,I am very Happy to resolved my concern timly & i would be suggest to my family members & my friends to download tata neu app shop with very good experince
30,app,"My issue it not resolved. I can understand that TATA is constantly working on improvements in the new APP. I being a huge fan of TATA, it's my responsibility to stand with TATA at this early stage. Hope all the issues including slow response of the APP to many transactions will be resolved soon. With that faith in TATA I keep on promoting the app amongst all my associates."
30,app,"Your app on iPhone is very slow, and ridden with bugs. Please resolve ASAP before customers loose interest."
30,app,This app need to improvise more from all the aspects from consumer side.
30,app,"Please update Tata neu Payment system user interface should be quick or fast.at similar conditions other apps are quick (like phone pe, bhim)"
30,app,"I am really not happy as i am using TATA NEU from past 4-5 months being a TATA employee customers are cheated , My problem was not solved. Why we take help from customer care to get a solution but till now no action or call from any one what care are you taking over your customers. Very pathetic to see such service by not giving what actual is. Never faced this issue ....I have given screeshots but no use , I have shared the proofs of transaction , order summary but till now no reply on this same & query is directly marked as closed without solution."
30,app,I hope Tata will do best Quality services/Business. This application and its alignments are too bad. We indians always support Tata. Before Tata always bothered about Indias. Great step. ?
30,app,I really like the app but why do i need to provide govt id to change the name and DOB which i haven't entered the app took by itself and even google doesnt asks id proof an all to change name and DOB
30,app,"Customer service and the CROMA store both work independently, NEU customer care representative should have access to order placed at store or on the app as well. It has been 5 days since i placed my order and till date nobody calls back to inform the status. Last time when I ordered using coins on the app, the product was delivered late and also was open. For past one month I am only trying to place order of echo dot."
30,app,I want you to remove any bugs that are present in this initial version of the app. Because the app wasn't responding when I tried multiple times to register to UPI.
30,app,Bogus and fraud app
30,app,Surprised to basic things are not working. Waste of time to use this app
30,app,"Include more products in each & every category! There are a lot of commercial products missing in ur super app! I was searching for gym equipments like resistance band, pull up bar etc. But I couldn't find any of them except tread mill & few others! There is no other options left for us than amazon & Flipkart!"
30,app,"Hi, I am a UX designer and I was just browsing the application. I came across a big problem that I did not receive any notification of the customer service representative responding to my query. Apart from the chat support I came across a lot of bugs that are present in the application."
30,app,Totally disappoints
30,app,Better to move away from thjs app
30,app,Totally disappointed with the level of support getting from last 2-3 days
30,app,Your App launch with Many Many Many errors and bugs. Tata must study on competitors app like Paytm phone pay etc. Can't expect such poor app from Tata. It's Super flop app.
30,app,The app/website just does not work. I had 2 payment failures already. I will not recommend this to any friend.
30,app,Fraud app and no mechanism for comaplaints.
30,app,The application is very slow
30,app,Pls don't need this app ...i got payment debited but still I didn't get phone main thing I'm talking with customer care he said for 7 working days ..no phone money debited again need to wait for 7 days for refund why should all these headache just becoz of this app...pls don't make customer fools..becoz you don't know that how that money come from just simply 7 days it's easy but what about customer choice that phone is important for him can't even think for customer side .. simply technical issues all those stupid stuff.why should i need to msg all for this ..just becoz tata companies _/\_ pls don't spoil true legends names...will you help me out for this transaction
30,app,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
30,app,I was a BIG hopeful and promoted the new TATAneu app but this app is not ready for market . Not at all .Not expected from TATA
30,app,Improve the app and service faster
30,app,Lot of improvement needed for the app especially the integration with related companies. Also no UPI Option is a huge let down.
30,app,Ur not responding properly I lost around 5777 rs by useing ur app i Don't know weather it will be refunded or not 5000 in UPI and 777 in bil payment to mescom
30,app,"Its been more than 72hrs no resolution for my query instead asking again 72hrs, app needs to be improved a lot"
30,app,My issue is not yet resolved and the ticket is closed I am not able to register on Tata neu app
30,app,I HAVE BEEN USING TATANEU FROM PAST 4 TO 5 MONTHS..Tata Neu is getting stuck/Hanged a lot ...it taking time to load ....please work on it .It is very beneficial app...but its affecting the enjoyment of surfing and shopping because of slowing and loading issues
30,app,"Happy with customer support executive, resolved my issue. Got back my neucoins, awaiting payment reversal.. Unhappy with failed transaction, no info on why transaction failed, if this is going to happen again with neucoins, why would I use neu app?"
30,app,"Never got a response from the customer representative. No message or intimation of what will happen to the transaction amount (will it be refunded, I hope it will, in how many hours/days/weeks, no message) I am completely in the dark about the status. Very disappointed."
30,app,"My first transaction is gone bezerk , I tried buying groceries but my payments are just failing it has happened twice now."
30,app,"Never i would recommend, atleast at this initial raw stage where payment gets debited from your account but never gets reflected in the app, then u need to for a week to get back your money"
30,app,"The customer service needs to have a better knowledge , understanding of the offers that have been advertised. It is not the onus of the customer to prove what offers are currently advertised. They should be made aware. However the overall experience was good and i love the presentation of the app"
30,app,So much disappointed with app profile details edit
30,app,Useless app
30,app,extremely disappointed that you closed my ticket without my consent
30,app,The customer service execute and your online chat app window both neeeds IMPROVEMENT
30,app,My issue didn't resolve yet. Didn't receive the refund for the technical issues of tata neu app. Worst app ever. No call received from the customer care executive
30,app,"Your customer care services are too good ,but please make more updates in neu app , specially add light mode too ?"
30,app,I have done recharge of Rs. 437 to tata sky through tata neu app but the transaction showing is pending. The money has been debited from my account. However today customer care is telling me that my transaction is successful which is incorrect as it is not showing in app. It is marked pending. I have made recharge through Amazon pay then only I am able to watch tv. My issue needs to be resolved.
30,app,It is nice opportunity. Thank you giveing me .very fast approval & best customer care service
30,app,"No one called, very poor and bad response both customer care team and app"
30,app,Tata neu app many lapse right now so i dont recommend friends nd family overall this customer executive is good listner
30,app,"We have booked one order and we did not get that order delivered by big basket , where as order directly placed via big basket how ever that order did not deliver Later we cancelled reimbursement was not received just because I have recommended this app , I have paid all the refund to the one who booked in this worst and customer service has no idea what's going on"
30,app,He not give me proper answer I m asking about my neu coins my purchase date is before launch date that time we gate 5% neu coins from both place store & application but he told me other options
30,app,"Loyalty programs have been there for long. Tata digital has been in the works for long and you have also been taking help of Bain and other consulting firms. It is very surprising that inspite of these, rewards, in this case airline, are not well structured , even after being designed and implemented by orgs serving global customers. Disappointed. Hope to see a better version soon."
30,app,Very slow app not look like Tata
30,app,Simple request for return of Product is placed on the day of delivery still no one is looking into it?? For processing return request why so much time required?? Other App allowing Returns without Questions & very fast process of refund/replacement. I was expecting Tata will give competition to these foreign companies but my first experience is totally disappointing.
30,app,Wonderful app but discontinue other subsidiary apps
30,app,Poor app experience
30,app,application is good but it lags and freezes. also i am not able to understand how does my mobile number reflect my mother's name. its getting pre populated from some other associated application and not letting the user make the necessary change is troublesome.
30,app,The call never even happened. How do you guys close the complaint without calling the customer?
30,app,"Very bad experience, not happy because the issue is still unresolved."
30,app,"Even to change my profile name, tata neu executives are asking for my PAN Card or Aadhaar card copy which I feel gross violation of my privacy. I would neither use nor recommend this app to others"
30,app,"Need to improve more for smooth payment like individual app i.e.bigbusket ,1 mg etc"
30,app,Complete details are not listed on app. Please update the correct details
30,app,You ask me to share a screenshot of the app. Is this Tata Digital or a joke? The app does not allow to take a screenshot on the UPI screen. Please use the app yourself first. Don't be in a hurry to close the tickets without resolving the problem.
30,app,The app experience has to be smooth. Payment through Tata pay via BB app has been working very well but today when I tried ordering from Neu app it didnâ€™t work.
30,app,I want to apply for personal loan but getting error again & again from last 8 days
30,app,Loving the app and amazed the way the customer service agent addressed the problem
30,app,I'm not happy with the resolution.
30,app,Very bad experience all of sudden you all have changes terms and conditions i have done a shopping from bigbasket app but i didn't got any neo coin where earlier i used to get
30,app,I am very happy with quick service
30,app,Good app but some technical glitches.. common for new app.. overall good
30,app,Very much happy with the support
30,app,extremely dissappointed.. Neu is not prepared yet..failures on multiple fronts...only bill payment worked fine...please relaunch post perfecting...we expect a lot from Tata :-)
30,app,excellant approach and issue resolving capacity shown by Executive especially Abhishek and Shradha
30,app,Superb app.
30,app,I think there is a need for improvement in the portal service. The app was getting hanged a couple of times.
30,app,Either it is issue with app or customer service person but the responses are quite delayed
30,app,"You made so much hype about this app, you said you will initially test it only with employees and their refeerrals. But now you say it is still not ready? And if you knew that this is a known issue, then why did you previously say to clear the cache and send screenshot?"
30,app,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
30,app,I cancel my order but not help your site I very disappointed
30,app,"If the app can not handle tata group's own business transactions, then what is the point in launching this app?"
30,app,Though I did not get any resolution however giving a positive rating as the application Is from the house of TATA & the advisor could not provide any resolution due to process limitations.
30,app,My issue was not resolved. Tried multiple attempt but the app is not user friendly. I wanted to exchange my shirt what I have ordered due to size issue but there was no option available so I had to return it.
30,app,Superb app more than others online app it's different and help full for middle class people
30,app,Good Experience and very professional approach
30,app,Mr Richard has no idea about 1% for under the question. Please appointment good train employee for chat care requesting to you please
30,app,"your app works to slow ? ? much slower than Google pay and phone pay, do some about it my friend, I want to use it, but it buffer a lot...?? I was at the petrol station in the morning, I don't know why app's QR scanner was not working at all, it couldn't scan the QR code...."
30,app,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
30,app,"I trust on TATA , so I am now slightly disappointed because of my payment"
30,app,Awaiting to enable TATA NEU app Globally
30,app,For 4th Question I choosed 5 Rating because Overall Experience is somewhat good. However Payment section is very much confusing. Mode of payment automatically becomes COD is weak point of application (as per me). Also Along with Tata Pay other options such as Gpay should be given. Eagerly waiting for Tata Pay App.
30,app,Very good app
30,app,Issues was yet to address the app directly log out me also the issues is still pending
30,app,"Toll Free No. is Stich off, Whats app is not helpful . on this stage i can't recommend to my Friends , colleague & Family"
30,app,"The app response was very very slow I had to spend 2hr to book one order, it needs lots of improvement."
30,app,Very poor app and very poor customer support.
30,app,Pathetic experience with regards to Qik loan. I regret applying for it.
30,app,I contacted 2 times. Both executives asked me to wait for 2 mins and they didnâ€™t come back after that. Nothing more disappointing and disrespectful than this.
30,app,App has a lot of bugs. Makes it very irritating at times while using the app
30,app,Customer service needs much training. They r putting calls on long hold and have no knowledge on queries. What the app says and what the service member state are contradicting. Much improvement needed on this front.
30,app,Using this app for the first time itself a disaster
30,app,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
30,app,"Your apps experience Good but light bill, telephone bill, postpaid bill, Insurance premium, Money transfer, Book my show and PVR, bus booking, Mobile recharge, DTH all services available and cash back offer total service your tata neu apps"
30,app,"There is a serious process issue. It has happened thrice to me. When is use Neu coins, the payment fails but my credit card is debited. Need to fix it before customers lose trust. Serious issue! Pls work on war footing.."
30,app,I am unable to pay through TaTa neu app at BPCL petrol pump
30,app,I complained on 11 th and spoke to sneha bhondve now it is more than 72 hours no one can find my order I didn't get my 5 per cent neucoins I ordered from tataneu app but no benefit I didn't get my 34 neucoins and waste of time chatting again and again for same issue again another 24 hours. App is full of glitch.
30,app,Query was not clarified and misinformation about neu coins that you get minimum assured coins on transactions via tata neu app or web. The customer service agent was not aware of the fact written in faq that neu coins are assured on all transactions via tata neu app
30,app,Fake app
30,app,Disruption.. the agent was checking on the details but disappeared or the session was disconnected. The issue is not resolved
30,app,"It seems there are a few bugs in the system which remain to be addressed. Here are 2 of them - 1. The app does not allow to manually update the address. In my case the GPS locator continued to wrong address of an adjacent building and the did not allow me to update it manually. 2. The DOB field asks me to add the date in in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format ! There could be many more but I was stuck with these basic ones and wanted to raise a ticket for the same. But, helpdesk kept asking me to send screenshot!"
30,app,"Though the App integrates all Tata Brands, operational integration to meet even the current standards (and hence customer expectation) is a long way. Case in point: Big Basket allows to order upto 10 pm ist and still deliver next day morning at 6 am. It does not happen when ordering the same on Tata Neu, though it says, rather claims its powered by Big Basket. If that was the case, I, as a customer, would have seen the same service levels. Will continue to experiment and hope that the current service levels are maintained at the very least."
30,app,The app is completely slow and it's taking much more time to open a page and it's not simple to use
30,app,"I visited the Croma store at Vasant Kunj to purchase two Voltas Air Conditioners. I requested the bill to be made with my GST so I could claim the benefit. While making the bill I was informed that they couldn't enter my full name as the records, entered by someone at a Croma store while making a purchase earlier, had been registered with just my surname. What started then was a process that would put even the most leaden-footed bureaucracies to shame. First I was told to download the TATA Neu app and asked to change my name there. When the app didn't respond, I was informed that it takes only three characters and the name will have to be changed by calling customer care. I called customer care and had Mr. Mahesh attend the call who was very receptive. He asked me to email my Adhar Card and then issued me a ""ticket"". This email was sent at 7 PM and at 12.54 AM I received an email from Mr. Amit Shah asking me to send a Government Approved ID. This was most strange as this email was in response to the email in which I had sent the Adhar Card as an attachment. On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there! This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further."

30,app,Chat response of the representative was not visible on the app. Also when the user types more than a line of text the text box width does not increase
30,app,It takes a lot of time before money reaches the concerned quarters. Needs to drastically reduce it.Since it is a new app i shall give it more time to stabilise its operations
30,app,Tata pay doesnâ€™t work in app
30,app,Highly unappreciative
30,app,Highly unappreciative
30,app,I'm unhappy
30,app,Very bad experience the Tata neu app.
30,app,App clearly mention 5% assured neu coin if you puchased through neu app. I did transaction through neu app not through croma app. But consider just 3 coins is faulty.
30,app,The experience of your customer care is really nice. The staff was really cooperative and had helped me out to sort out my issue. It is really great to use your app. Thank you. Look forward to further cooperation
30,app,Highly unappreciative
30,app,Because doesn't work properly so i didn't recommend any one to use this app...
30,app,You need to work on the app to make it world class. Nowhere near to what consumers are used to with other shopping apps
30,app,Everything is good but Tata app is bad experience I can't apply EMI card
30,app,"I was very eager to use the new app. however, my experience was not a happy one. My first recharge didnâ€™t go through and the money was also deducted. I also observed various bug and latency issue in the app. I am using ios phone."
30,app,You just made it khicdi payment app which is not user friendly and design interface is very bad. Don't make it khichdi we not aspect from TATA
30,app,I think the app is very buggy and slow. The UI UX is sub par. If you check Big Basket or Cliq Luxury the UI UX is far superior. The â€œNâ€ logo is really big when it comes up during searches or redirects. There doesnâ€™t seem to be a flow of things. A lot of work is required right now. The CS chat was slow. The representative took. Long time to get back.
30,app,Inspiite of several complaints my problem is not solved and I am not able to place any order on your app
30,app,"I think yoy should take time to update your app. It takes ages to transfer money, the executives on chat unable to resolve issues. So are the executives manning customer care email. Zero problem solving capacity. It is bringing bad name to you as of now."
30,app,"Received call from mobile no 9111458548 at around 6.55 pm on 16.04.2022 and he said to me that i am getting the call closed of your however the goods will be delivered late to night, but nothing happen. Then around 06.57 pm received another call from 011244577350 that your phone is unanswered hence the goods are not being delivered to you. Its my first experience with TATA NEU which i could nor relish. Just sharing my experience so that other customers should not bear the brunt of it and TATA NEU should sail to new heights."
30,app,"Since the launch of the app. I have not been able to purchase anything from any of the Tata's brand like Bigbasket, TataCliq, IHCL. I have already raised an issue with the customer care team and asked me to wait for 72 hours but still hasn't been solved. I have been Tata's customer for around 20 years and there have been very few occasion where I have been let down by the team. I really hope that they get to the bottom of this and solve this issue asap."
30,app,"Iam very upset with Tata Neu, i used to earn good number of coins while using BB app. Now it has suddenly stopped stating i need to buy through Tata Neu? was there any communication???????????????? i have placed 2 orders 1632/- and 1225/- where i was supposed to earn 10% extra neu coins. I received a message that 10% additional coins would be added to my account. Now i have received a message that it was wrongly stated i will not be getting the coins !!!!!!! is this a joke?"
30,app,Worst ever experience facing with the app from the day one still nothing got improved. I am a Tata product user for very long time. But going to delete the app .
30,app,Very Happy With the way the App is customized.
30,app,"1st Transaction with your app and i landed in trouble and now will have to payment due charges also because of your app. Also, your team does not have clue where my money is pending and when it will be refunded Despite of sharing everything they have not done anything from past 48 hours"
30,app,"very disappointed , not expected from a Tata group company"
30,app,"Tata brand doesnâ€™t need to get into coercive methods to ensure stickiness for its brand, so itâ€™s disappointing that you are resorting to it! Eg ok 1MG why would you force users to pay through your wallet only instead of usual gpay to be able to avail neu coins redemption. Also if I want to exit as a customer out or Tata neu you donâ€™t even have a process that ensures my data is deleted at your end nor does your team know anything about it"
30,app,"I performed the necessary transaction on BigBasket via TataNeu app for 1200+ amount. And as per the listed promo on app, I expect 10% Tata Neu coins to be credited in my account, but I got ZERO for now. And worst there's no explanation for it."
30,app,I purchased a phone from tata croma at 24th of march . At that time the store manager promised me if i take the phone i will get cash back from tata neu in 16 days . I was fake marketed by tata croma to make the bill . It was not the way to do the sales . Now they are telling at that time tata neu app was not active . I had many other options to buy electronics. But i preferred tata croma . Because i was trusted for the reputation. But this is very wrong . To mislead the customer with fake promises . Never expected this from a tata enterprise
30,app,Was extremely disappointed with the resolution he tried to give.. he wasnâ€™t sure what he was talking about and started conflicting his words and later started apologizing.. why tata neu cs team trying to waste consumers time like this.. extremely disappointed
30,app,The Neu app needs a lot of improvement to be user friendly
30,app,The concept of chat within the app is a great feature. ??? The only drawback that I found in that feature is that we cannot go back to the exact chat once you get disconnected somehow.
30,app,Sabko bol dunga mat use Karo ye app. Sab chor hai. Maine headphones order kiya tha. Delivery nahi hui aur 14 April ko msg bhej diya . Apka parcel deliver ho gaya. Tab se ab tak mai call karke puch raha hu. Lekin koi jawaab nahi de rahe hai. Bas gol gol ghuma rahe hai. Hire authority ko bheja hai apka complaint. Investigation chal raha . Bad app Bad service ?
30,app,"first payment deducted from account, but not confirmed by receiver app, freecharge,thus money got blocked"
30,app,not happy with the customer care service
30,app,I haven't received new coins for two Big basket orders and I am chasing it for almost 15 days till the resolution is pending I am completely disappointed and I am frustrated now
30,app,"Please find some feedback 1. Neo app is slow 2. Please add more biller to list like insurance , credit card payment , bus booking etc Thanks"
30,app,Very bad experience I have not received new coins for my two orders which was place through Tata new app all the agents are the feedback that I have received is that I have placed order directly through Big basket website but I am using this apps since last three months I click on grocery it took me to Big basket website and from there I have made payment so I have not open any separate account on big basket nor I have made any order directly on big basket website
30,app,"A company of your repute shouldnâ€™t have come out with this app, as you are unable to find solution. I canâ€™t complete my profile at all. Unable to send money also. I am deleting the app forever"
30,app,The application is not stable and payment gateway require improvement.
30,app,No clarity on how police will work. Will Croma offer applies in this app?
30,app,Very bad and tortured experiences with Tata neu app5
30,app,Instant response likely to be updated in this app
30,app,"u have come out with Tata Neu without fully constructing. Profile doesn't work at all. After filling every thing, it again ask to fill in yyyy/mm/dt format which is not possible. I am surprised a company of your repute can come out with such a thing. I am disapppointed"
30,app,u have come with this app before fully constructing it. Profile does not work at all. I am utterly disappointed as a company of your repute can do this. I am sorry
30,app,my money got stuck in tata neu app no one resolved even after 72 hours deadline over and they are raising again and again. transaction successful but not received order yet
30,app,This is where you are legging behind as compared to other shopping apps. Where other online shopping apps are offering next day demo and installation. The TV I purchased got deliver on Saturday 16 april. As per customer care executive I have to wait for 7 days to get my TV installed and demo. thank you Sandeep Kumar
30,app,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
30,app,"Iam applying personal loan 13/04/2022 to day 19/04/2022 my personal loan amount not credited my Bank account, Iam 5 times complient, but my problem not solved. How much time my personal loan amount disbursal my bank account ?"
30,app,Highly disappointed
30,app,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
30,app,"Theres a bot answering queries on the app, No Good. Also too many hidden T&Cs to earning Neu points, which are nor clear at first"
30,app,You will 1st update app other wise iwill suggest
30,app,1. In reply complaint ref no not quoted. 2. No solution to.complaint coins not credited. 3. Non standard application. 4. Useless customer service. They need to be watched and replaced. Reply like we have further forwarded complaint is no solution.
30,app,I am not able to place grocery items through TATANeu app. During final placing of order it says checkout and asks to provide my email id and subsequently not updating and giving error message. Tried all things but no success.
30,app,Very poor app and even poorer caller
30,app,"Very bad team, no use, no resolution of issues Waste of time and energy Tata's doing R&D at the cost of customers time energy and effort Useless app in the world"
30,app,The best app i have come across. I hope we have Air India n Vistara on board soon ? ?.
30,app,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
30,app,"Recharge amount rs.839/- not done for that they're told me 72 hrs it will rectify, after that again they told me wait for 7 days. whats app also only one repeated message is wait for update. After 6 days they didn't update. customer care executive also told me for call back arranged.till now I didn't receive a single call."
30,app,It will be premature to treat matter as resolved as yet. The payment not reaching beneficiary even after days of complaint is very unsatisfactory feature.It makes the app very unreliable. Need urgent action to rectify it.
30,app,Worst customer service....i request Tata to close this Neu app immediately
30,app,good app - Thanks for support
30,app,"The customer services is wrost. . I am not able to make upi id, not able to use emi card, personal loan. So why this app is made for?"
30,app,when I send money to someone account. after exit from app I am not able to see history.
30,app,Pathetic application I am continuously chasing with customer care I have not received new points for my two order resolution is pending but still the tickets are closed from there and no one is responsible I am just getting your time or best we will help there is no solution to my problem I am always hurting mail they are replying something other thing only I am going to discontinue using this app
30,app,"Having already given feedback once, I am getting an email every day asking for feedback. What kind of feedback do you want for spamming? Also, I was told by the Croma store owner that the ACs would be installed in 48 hours. It's 96 hours now and the ACs are still to be installed. I have been calling repeatedly over the past 2 days and all I get to hear from the installation team is, it'll happen in the next 30 minutes!"
30,app,"my single problem has not been solved. No one is able to give a solution, neither do they have any info to share on the order. The app is in a very bad condition currently"
30,app,What happen with my deducted money?
30,app,Ten days back personal loan approved Still amount not disbursed in my account
30,app,App is slow. Not user friendly. Long way to go before you can match Amazon or Flipkart s app.
30,app,"The representative appeared after 15 min. though it was mentioned earlier.need to increase CC representatives.problem was for 1mg site, the Neu Customer Support suggested to resolve it through 1mg Help support.it is hampering the concept of Neu app."
30,app,My query is still same.why my last transaction is showing pending on the neu app.
30,app,"You don't have much offer i applied referral code but didn't received anything or any reward your whole app collaboration through this Tata nue is glitchy and laggy it frustrated me to shop through Tata Nue, So I shopped through the particular app that is bigbasket app to place grocery order."
30,app,"My mobile no is already registered by some other name. I am not able to change the name, nor am able to enter any details like DOB. Two mail communications with Neu were also futile. So I deleted the application also. Poor service from TATA group surprisingly."
30,app,I am having trouble using the user interface. Itâ€™s not friendly as compared to the UI of the bigbasket app.
30,app,"Useless app, my first transaction failed."
30,app,Highly disappointing service
30,app,"the app is horrible in terms of response , there is no way to monitor returns and the cash balance with TATA neu is not visible . There is no customer support menu , one has to go to transaction in the mother app to log a ticket , which is ridiculous ."
30,app,"i asked for telangana electricity board bill payment thru tata neu app not AP electricity board, i hope you under stand the problem, thank u"
30,app,Three weeks back personal loan approved but still amount is not credited in my account
30,app,Tata is love but i would would love if you guys give option to shop from all apps rather than selectively for example if i want electronic it shows croma but tatacliq also gives electronics so add a option which enables us to open any site irrespective of category.
30,app,I had a query on the offer on Big basket for which I received an email which said that you get 10% tata neu coins when you shop at Bigbasket using the Tata neu app. However I received only 5%. On reaching the customer care she was not clear on the offer. She mentioned that I would not get any coins as I paid using existing neu coins which I feel is incorrect.
30,app,Totally disappointed
30,app,Still facing problem on registration of upi from the first day app was installed
30,app,Recharge has done before 24 hours still not happened
30,app,Very good experience. Nice app
30,app,Personal loan approval but not received my Bank account disbursal customer service representative not
30,app,"improve the app , just getting it working please"
30,app,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
30,app,Too many glitches with the app on Android. On iOS its impossible to view any items as app keeps getting freezed. Have given this feedback on the playstore and appstore as well 2 weeks back but still app is not fixed.
30,app,Need improve the user interference need to benchmark some digital payment app .i feel app is to slow
30,app,Your tata neu app is bakwaas in comparison of Amazon
30,app,very much disappointed with your service.. its been 3 days since I did a recharge.. still pending.. no refund
30,app,Really disappointed with the app and my transaction issue
30,app,"My Electricity bill transaction was made on 13th Apr but till showing pending. I had chat with customer service he was told my issue will resolve with 72 hours. But now overed more than 72 hours, till my issue not resolved. Please return my amount I will pay my bill with other apps. Very bad experience."
30,app,"I had placed an order for a large appliance amounting to Rs. 16,191/- on 19.04.2022. For two days I did not get a confirmation on the status of the order and now I am being told that due to a technical glitch the order is being cancelled and my refund is being processed which would take another 4-5 working days to be credited to my bank account. What feedback do you expect me to give? Is my money and my time not worth it. I have lost offer on the order. How are you going to make up for all these things? Please be kind enough and let me know the answers to these questions also"
30,app,1)Firstly the application is very slow and not responsive 2)Not able to provide solutions to the problem.
30,app,Not happy bcse of very late service as i hv send so many email for my disbursement of personal loan & still not disbursed in my bank account... not happy at all with Tata Finance Sorry to say
30,app,Not have good experience with Tata Neu . Disappointing with Tata as never expected this kind of quality from Tata
30,app,Highly disappointed.
30,app,I don't know how u cater other customers but for me it was bad experience with this application. Nothing worked just my time & data wasted. Please build strong customer care service.
30,app,The problem is not with the customer service ...the problem is with the app itself ....Firstly fix the problem i cant add my bank details tried so many times The bank sms verfication will success but unable to add fetch (link) bank every time its get failed
30,app,"There was no call from your customer care dept. My grievance that unable to down load your TATA NEU app from google play store remain unanswered. It says"" this item is not available in your country. I bought my samsung s7edge in USA using in india with airtel."
30,app,"The new app is pleasing. You are sure to add so many new facilities in the future to raise to the challenges of already established players like Amazon,PayTm etc. Add some interesting genuine contests for prize winnings to keep the customers with your app. Amazon does it great.But,be INDIAN with the contests. Maybe Indian history,Indian achievers etc."
30,app,"I'm dissatisfied with the service provided to me. Even after paying money online, I had to wait for 3 days just to get a response form query. I didn't waited for 3 days just to get a refund. How do I recommend this app to someone else when even employees of Tata group are facing these kind of issues."
30,app,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
30,app,"Despite escalating the delay in return pickup, no action has been taken and once again the return pick up agent has wrongly postponed the pickup by mentioning that I had requested for a later date (this has been happening again and again)."
30,app,"Worst service,worst app, i will delete this app, once my refund is back"
30,app,"No emi payment option at check out , apps needs so much improvement so many lags and limitations"
30,app,I wrote the mail regarding the error I am getting while profile creating and while login into the TataNeu app. Not resolved still
30,app,Worst app
30,app,"Very poor service here onwards I'm not in use and also not recommended to others very poor and bad ,worst application"
30,app,I wouldn't recommend it at all. The app is buggy and slow. U need to improve it a lot. If you couldn't have proper communication/collaboration between ur app partners then its a complete wastage of both urs and customers time. May be i will never get back here. Good bye..
30,app,"I don't think I can recommend Tata Neu to anyone at this point. I just placed 2 orders through Tata Neu so far and I faced major technical issues. On top of it, your customer care executive mentioned that the servers are down since more than a day. This is very disappointing and left me with a bad experience using Tata Neu. I'm still unable to get the product I needed from Croma, even after multiple follow ups."
30,app,It was a bit time consuming to explain to the CSR and the app also took some time to transmit the chat
30,app,still have some better/faster/user friendly/safer apps available in market. so improvement needed.
30,app,"Good app.One problem faced,if I book ticket through app I will get points only for my ticket.So if my family is with me other all flight ticket purchased will be pointless.Which has to be rectified.Thanks"
30,app,On 15th Apr I rang up Tata Neo as I was redirected by Taj Inner Circle that my issues will be resolved by Tata Neo. I had ordered redemption of 2500 TIC points to Taj Experience Gift card worth Rs 2500 on 10 Mar 2022. Inspite of my reminders to TIC I didn't get any reply and hence approached Tata Neo. Executive receiving my call assured me that the matter has been escalated and that I would get a reply within 24 hours. There wasn't any response till 19th Apr and hence again approached Tata Neo on 19th Apr. I received similar reply as on 15th Apr that I would within 24 hours receive intimation. Till now no response and hence not in a position recommend Tata Neo positively.
30,app,My concern still not resolved. First experience is very bad. I don't think will purchase anything from this app.
30,app,"App starting offer (refer friends/family) is fake one.this app launch April 7 but, this offer valid of before 31mar. So funny how can I use this offer.not mentioned any place offer validity and this offer valid is closed please remove offer from app.i refered 5 friends and I ask customer care chat to reward.she told offer is already closed. please don't cheat customers."
30,app,Neu app application response is low some times hangs Particularly tracing order and tracking is not easy and tracking the return stays and pick status not very friendly lost to understand where I am. Tracking should be made easy. directly accsable
30,app,This is second time i am experiencing this. Executive has not contacted and have closed the ticket with out addressing the issue. I am really helpless and i will make sure i wont recommend this app to anyone.
30,app,"This app is not support properly. Not user friendly interface at all. I am trying to place an order for grocery products, several times, but not be able to do that. Only one order was delivered successfully, that was a Linen Shirt from TataQlik. But beside that, I am not be able to place any order from this app. Totally dissatisfied."
30,app,your application UI is worst
30,app,"The app has problems I guess. You need to attend to it. Although your managers spoke to me and understood the problems, and have even promised a resolution, it would be great to see those actions taken."
30,app,The app needs work...it still gets hang at times which affects your confidence to carry out financial transactions
30,app,My issue still remains unresolved as they have not given me statement of my last at least 10 transaction in Tajinnercircle and It appears that I have lost all past points due to merger of membership. I am not satisfied at all. Regards Anoop Kumar Sharma 8291086676
30,app,Which ticket and what resolution? I've been promised an update and a callback but no updates yet. You have a half baked product/app in market. Your customer representative are incapable of handling any technical issues apart from blaming your own back-end team or server. Asking for 24hrs time.. what kind of world this app lives in 90s?
30,app,"Poor app, poor service"
30,app,As earlier i explain the issue for unable to download app on my Iphone 13 pro since last 20 days but nobody resolve the issue
30,app,My Experience with regards to the purchasing was extremely bad. My issue is not resolved. I hard for me to recommend this app to someone else since this has happened to me on my first purchase
30,app,My Tata 1mg wallet balance of Rs 22.92 has not yet been transferred to Tatneu account as NeuCoins though Tata 1mg App shows migration done on 9th April. No resolution despite 6 calls to Tataneu customer support who keep mentioning that team is working on the issue(though sleeping will be more appropriate) and it will be resolved in 24-72 hours. I have to order my repeat prescription and requested that amount be manualy credited to my account pending resolution. Customer Support has become a joke with no access to responsible person. Shame on Tata Group including TCS in launching such a bad product.
30,app,"I have been chasing the support team for a small issue for the past 20 days now. Everytime a new ticket is opened, a new question is asked and then I have to wait for their response. I am myself an employee of Tata and wasn't expecting such support from another entity. Really Really disappointing. Saksham"
30,app,My good suggestion to tata neu app is Please close this app immediately I loose Rs 29000. Tata neu cheating me Rs 29000. Still i am not receiving.
30,app,"I am applying uqik loan my loan is sanction 40000 , sanction letter is come , but stll amount is not credit to my account,daily I will call customer care but she tell wait today only , still complete 10 days ammount is not credit"
30,app,Since 16.4.22 I am requesting about my issue time and again but no solution till 23.4.22 All my tickets are open/pending/reopen Hurt a lot and very disappointed Please resolve my issue at an earlist to continue trust with you
30,app,"The fact that Tata Neu only reached out to me after 4 chat message discussions with customer service reps and 1 call itself says a lot worse about Tata Neu CS. I also have an inkling to why this could be happening. When I first palced a replacement request no one listened..and when I asked for cancellation and refund it was immediately picked up within 12 hours. 1. You never had a replacement product. 2. You knew that this product was substandard (pack was June 2020. i,.e almost 2 yr old lying unsold in a godown in gujarat) and hence it was offered at an attractive price to clear it off. 3. Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works..Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service . Request to let it reach the head of CS. Tata Neu didnt live up to Neu. Nothing new in Neu."

30,app,"Even though all in one app is an excellent idea, viewing the cart can be simplified. Similarly payment option doesn't display UPI"
30,app,"Not going to recommend to place any order from you as you don't have control on the issues raised by customer.as you can only raise a ticket and wait for the brand to reply..until then what customer should do..no response n resolution..waste to use this app.instead use Jiomart,Amazon ,Flipkart for most needa..this tata Neu is a shitty basket hunch"
30,app,"Useless app, you can't change of your name, too much payment failure, I am gonna uninstall it totally waste of time, Amazon, flipkart is far better than this useless scrab"
30,app,I am not able to avail priority slots even though I am bbstar member on tata nue. The app shows I am base customer
30,app,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.
30,app,Didn't answer my question appropriately
30,app,"actually i applied for QIK EMI card on 15-04-2022 they said to me 1,20,000 thousand limit after document verification u can use card from then im follouping them what is my card status they telling will picup documents manually but they are calling to me when i chat with them about my concern same they are telling please try to give right infirmation to customer THANKYOU"
30,app,Worse application from Tata
30,app,"Horrible experience. After repeated chats, no neu points were added even though my transaction for big basket was much more than the amount for additional neu points. Forget that, the transaction is still not even displayed on the tata neu app even though my order was delivered one day back already. Horrible experience!"
30,app,"multiple attempts made to make agent understand the concern. most of the times agnet didnt even bother to read what the issue is and replied. As of today, problem is not resolved nor the neucoins have been added as per offer but i have given up. Tata has always meant 'trust' but apparently the core value itself is getting challenged it seems"
30,app,I am awaiting my refund for the cancellation of hotel booking at Taj palace Delhi through Tata Neu app. It is more than 10 days and I havenâ€™t yet received my refund
30,app,"Issue is still there, not able to see nue coins credited due to my order in 1mg. Disappointed"
30,app,Personal loan approved but still amount not disbursed in my account Cancel NACH in my account immediately
30,app,Your app is too slow . Customer care service also needs improvement.
30,app,"I requested for return of a product received through Tata Cliq, ordered on Neu app. The app accepted my return request, but I did not receive any text or email confirmation. So I initiated the chat. I was informed that refund request was noted. However, no text or email confirmation was received till I logged on to Tata Cliq website after 2-3 days. I made the request on Th we website and only then did I receive the email and text confirmation. So it is apparent that while I can make an order on Neu app, rsturm canâ€™t be done on app."
30,app,"I have bad experience when I have been recharged Tata play recharged for Rs.500- for my current account but it was reflected in my closed account . when I lodged complaint for that time replied by customer care Representative Rs.433- deducted from your closed account and remain only Rs.67- in balance in closed account.I was surprised , when I have recharged for my current account but how it was reflected in my closed account. I have lost my Rs.500- I disappointed from this app.and in future I was not use and not recommended to any one."
30,app,In this app please add all types of FMCG and nee brand in faction. All types products are users friendly in terms of finance.
30,app,"Highly disappointed with customer experience and there promises, I have purchased 2 iPhones and the sales representative told me that I will get 5% tata Neu points in my application after my purchase, I didnâ€™t get anything. Fake promises and commitments by the sales representatives."
30,app,"Not happy, because I didnâ€™t get any neu points as promised by the sales person"
30,app,app ui make app so beautiful One stop for all shoppingâ€¦!!!
30,app,They never understood my situation. I had entered wrong credit card details and transaction was declined by back. But your representative was saying transaction timed out hence failed. I wanted an option for repayment which the application did not have. Over all it waste of 1 hour.
30,app,Poor service i never recomend to any one to instal your app because i had face a very bad experience
30,app,"The app is fine but as a new user the kind of issue in facing is concerning. Once you purchase from the nue everything after that seems blank, where the product is, whom to connect. Tracking is quite plain that wil not give you any clue about the product location. I've asked the chat for the details and she told me it will delivered to you today and your will get the courier info which I got next day and the product also came late. Now for installation I've no idea whome to contact and when it will be done. It was promised while purchasing 72 hours, chat is telling me 7 days. The time of billing it showed my company name while submitting GST but the bill came under my name now it can't be changed and I've no option except returning this product. There are plenty of small areas that needs improvement and when you deal with TATA you expect something beyond simple."
30,app,Worst app played games with me
30,app,Improve the app UI. Currently its complicated and laggy
30,app,The app is not very user friendly. There was no update on the cancellation request raised on the app.
30,app,"Unable to add cards mannually. If added through scan, unable to add more than one. App is not user friendly and is just a combination of multiple apps with a common starting app. compars very poorly with Amazon which is a smooth operation in comparison. Unimpressive, coming from the Tata."
30,app,Absolutely worse customer care service and the app is absolutely of no use
30,app,Customer should hold the highest position in any business to flourish. At no point of time customer be put to any disadvantageous position. The migration from old to a new domain has not been totally successful. There are aberrations and the system should have run under some beta version sometime and hence creating a parallel eco system without affecting old or new customers. To cite an example I am not able to edit address in tataneu app and it's a technical glitch. A major overhaul is the need of the nour
30,app,The executives repeatedly promised call back which didn't happen on a single occasion. The promised installation was within 72 hours of delivery..after six days of delivery i am still clueless about the installation. completely disappointed
30,app,Please improve performance of the app. Its really very slow and have lots of defects.
30,app,Poor service i never recomend this app to anyone and also help others to dont waste your time and give details to this aap all fraud
30,app,"There are too many problems on the app and the CSR has no idea as to how to resolve them. They are not even competent enough to understand the problem, forget solving them. All they do is to give false assurances that the problem is being escalated to another team and that someone will get back to us in 72 hours. Nobody does. And each time they asj for an additional 72 hours to buy time and drag the matter because they have no idea of or interest in how to solve the problem. For example I had a problem about Neucoin migration and I was given a ticket No 724935 on 11th April and there has been no resolution or any progress even after 14 days. When I ask the CSR what progress or steps have been taken till date to resolve the issue, they have absolutely no idea....all they say is that 'the team is working on your problem and will solve the problem in 20 days'. So now 72 hours has become 20 days for Neucoin migration problems. ABSOLUTELY DISAPPOINTED. INCOMPETENT APP ....AND EVEN MORE INCOMPETENT SUPPORT TEAM. You guys should be ashamed that you are so carelessly maligning the good and trusted name of Tata which has been so laboriously built over decades ."
30,app,I have presented my migration of tata1mg cash 1622.81 on 11/04 to tata neu which is not yet transfer to tata neu but they did not bother to solve my complaint and just buying time.very very bad customer care approach.
30,app,Most disappointing customer service.useless service.
30,app,The return policy on the app is terrible. No way to initiate a return except to open a chat. Whoever was on the chat had no way how returns work. It took me 3 attempts for someone to raise a return request. Just compare with how easy Amazon makes it to return. Why make life so difficult for customers?
30,app,"The representatives were not at able to understand the issue, addressing it was a distant part. This shows very poor attitude from TATA group. They didnt send me the complaint mail even though they said they will. The concern is about serious issue with data privacy and I had already told them to solve it at highest priority else I ll have to approach concerned authority."
30,app,The app is not updating my bigbasket activity or updating invoices to add Neu coins. For every single transaction I have had to reach out to customer care to update the coins. What needs to fixed is the app so I donâ€™t have to reach out after every transaction. This is frustrating..if I have to reach out every time for a few Neu coins I would rather just order on Amazon or flipkart etc through HDFC smartbuy
30,app,really appreciate
30,app,No one came to chat and app is still hanging and not working only.
30,app,Make chat systems user friendly. I typed the content 3 times but it disappeared every time automatically without delivery to chat box or conversation
30,app,Contacted you multiple times but your agents are not aware of the issue happening with me and kept asking the same questions which didn't help. My issue is still not resolved
30,app,"The application doesnâ€™t stay online & so are the coins credits. However, redemption is prompt. Further, the application canâ€™t do simple arithmetics. Today I have three queries that are unresolved. I believe that with the way things are going, it may take considerable time to resolve simple matters of coins not rewarded for my stays at Taj. I have even sent invoicesâ€¦ Almost 10 days have gone by and thereâ€™s no response. Your chatbot is pathetic and frustrating & so are the executives on the other end. They canâ€™t resolveâ€¦ so why have them. I donâ€™t know how much this makes sense to you,,, but you have an unhappy customer who admires Mr. Ratan Tata & heâ€™s the reason for my continued patronage with Tata group."
30,app,Totally disappointed by the neu. Pls close down as this is defaming tata brand
30,app,Cannot even use the app
30,app,"I am really disappointed with this service because I got qik card of 1lakh limit and 50k personal loan limit but I am unable to take benifit of single one thing and no one responding just say forwarding your case to concern department and heighlite your case but they do nothing , total waste on the name of digital process."
30,app,"I did not want to, but have already uninstalled the app since my problem was not resolved or responded till date and nor did the customer service representative seemed interested to resolve it."
30,app,"They are not able to speak anything more than "" our ream is working on it"". Issues raised do not get resolved. Horrible experience. Neu coin concept appears to be grossly false."
30,app,"This app needs a lot of work. Not sure why it's been launced in haste. Major bug issues, slow interface and lots of mess around"
30,app,I dint get any input from customer care team so far. The issue is still happening
30,app,There is no option to rate it negative I am frustrated From thos app They are not solving My problem from last 8 days
30,app,Tata Neu and its affiliates have to really work hard on bring their return process to a level where you can really compete with the likes of Amazon. Your logistics partner Ekart is really bad when it comes to picking up a product. I placed two return requests on April 22 and they got picked yesterday. I wasted my whole weekend waiting for Ekart's executive to pick up my stuff and NO ONE turned up. This is highly disappointing. To top it off the customer service executive very calmly said it normally takes 3 working days to pick a product from data of initiation. Disappointed to the max.
30,app,"I asked for app crash/ closing automatically while tapping bill pay menue. Followed instructions given by representative, problem as it is after also.The problem not solved up to now."
30,app,They have no visibility of the issue and it may be an issue with the application and partner but it seems TATA neu is not ready to handle complaints or issues in the supply chain
30,app,I have already uninstalled the app so please do not try to contact again
30,app,"I didn't receive the neu coins for the flight tickets that I booked through the TATA Neu app, The Flight was initially booked by TATA Neu, however, the flight got Rescheduled by Air Asia, As per the customer care , it is Air Asia's fault that i couldn't get Neu Coins This is not a behavior that is Expected from a TATA Group Company, If it is the Response of the Group employees then what would be with others. You are requested to Resolve these issues and take this instance as learning."
30,app,The app is very slow and closes all of a sudden
30,app,The app hangs a lot. The chat with the CS executive took more than 5 mins. I accidently clicked another icon on the app and Boom! the chat was gone.. My Credit card was charged and there has been no refund till date.
30,app,Nothing happened. no call was received and no reply to my email.
30,app,App user friendliness itself needs quite a bit of improvement. Also if possible a same day delivery would be great for items which are picked up from the same city. Quite happy with the rewards and customer service.
30,app,Return Courier service person was speech very rude not a professional person really very disappointed
30,app,I could not log in first time. As i didnt get the OTP. so i deleted the app. I was excited to register to the app as it is a TATA app. But didnt get OTP
30,app,Useless app and customer service
30,app,"The app needs a lot of improvement. Introduce tata motors, air india, vistara in the app. Payment methods are still lacking. In my installed app, there are only two payments modes- netbanking and cards. There is no UPI mode for payment."
30,app,Dear sir i have an account in Tata neu linking with coporate tatasteel mail id but still I didnot got rewards like 1000 neu coin as per your offer.thaswhy i am very disappoint. Thanking you
30,app,Nice app
30,app,There are many many bugs. I am regd for TATA pay but when I buy anything that option is not there. Fixing that will make using the app seamless. Right now it doesnt make sense to use the app. Pls take this in the best possible spirit. I want to use TATA but it is not efficient.
30,app,Please add insurance premium payment section in Tata new app
30,app,Please try to spend some money on developing app and business and strong service before going for huge advertising campaigns spends without proper base of business advertising will just harm not only to this but also will disrepute the unimaginable goodwill on tata group that every citizen of this country believes
30,app,The customer care executive didnâ€™t bother to read my email and sent a standard reply after 2 days asking for product code. Thereâ€™s still a bug in the app and I believe many customers might be facing similar issue. Iâ€™m not happy with the reply as it doesnâ€™t solve the issue.
30,app,I am unable to change my name. Customer care gives false promises. Very disappointed
30,app,pathetic experience with Tata Neu. i have been Big Basket for almost 6-7 months. i have never had any issues with them previously and was very happy with the service & delivery was always on time. This is the first time i ordered thru Tata Neu & was greatly disappointed & eventually had to cancel my order. i will not recommend Tata Neu to anyone
30,app,"I am excited to use this super app from the house of tata. With a genuine interest to improve those services, i suggest thatthe product can be improved Best wishes"
30,app,My first dealing with TATANEU is totally disappointing . Items ordered were short supplied and querying unwanted and unnecessary things as if my claim is not bonafide Even though I lose both my money paid and goods I have painfully decided to cancel the application itself fro my device
30,app,Not happy at all
30,app,"You have launched the app in a hurry, there are lot of technical glitches and customers do not have the facility of choosing options in filters like list of products available under qik emi card and FAQ are not at all usefull. There is no clarity about what is what exactly defined."
30,app,Its a very simple issue yet it is made complex. Basic things are ignored while resolving the issue. There is not communication happening. It is always one way resolution.
30,app,Very much disappointed
30,app,bought a product from tata neu on 19th its already 28th and customer care guys have no clue when will the installation happen. Pathetic service
30,app,Your app doesnt provide any tracking details or courior number or location its very dissatisfying as we are unable to guess its location or its tentitive date
30,app,I have booked the flights. Because of name mismatch i am not eligible for neu coins. What's wrong in it if i use kumar in my name or not. That's my full name. I strongly disagree with the solution. This is my first and last booking with tata neu app. I am not going to use it anymore. Even i am Going to delete it now.
30,app,"This app used to lagg very much and secondly, i have 130 neu coins in my neupass but day after that when i see my neu coins it shows error and zero balance in neu pass and iam unable to use neu coin in Tata 1Mg."
30,app,Never suggest anyone to download this app
30,app,My order got cancelled again and again due to insufficient inventory....although i received the notification from the app itself about the medicine being back in stock.....i am trying since 2 weeks!this kind of service is being given to PREMIUM subscribers.....??â€â™‚ï¸pharm easy is best!
30,app,I had stayed in Taj Bangalore on 21 Jan 2022 and I do not see any points being added in Tata Neu. I was asked to get in touch again after 24 hours where as I had approached the rep after 4 days.
30,app,"Even though promotion emails are disabled in the Tata Neu app, I still get promotional emails"
30,app,The application bit seems working slowly. I'd be glad to see it runs like super-duper fast :)
30,app,very poor app didint returned money poor customer services waiting & chasing from past one month for getting my money back
30,app,I have two emails registered on my registered mobile number. My tata email ID and later my personal email ID. My request is which one should i keep and therefore the app should remove the other ID. Can someone help me My mobile number is 7303916518
30,app,9 days after the transaction.. still pending.. No refund... haven't seen such a pathetic app and customer service team ever in my life...disappointed
30,app,"Not able to use the app version , no solution provided !!! However I have recommended to 100s of people yet I myself canâ€™t use & avail benefits !"
30,app,"Please change the look of your App, very pathetic and not user friendly. Please remove the black colour, it is not at all appealing good, and creates more strain to the eyes. Never expected this kinf of App from Tata. Bigbasket app is very good and I will say one of the best App."
30,app,All good experience but ur app is not working properly
30,app,Customer Executives Simply reading out the information available in app / website
30,app,"The issue has still not been resolved, so why was this ticket closed? Extremely disappointed at your service!"
30,app,Tata Neo application mein abhi tak mera KYC complete hua nahin aur Paisa bhi discuss nahin ho raha hai aur aapka customer care mein se koi call bhi nahin kar raha hai
30,app,The problem still persists and nothing has been done to change that this app is a waste of time
30,app,Delivery did not happen on time.
30,app,"Customer service needs to be more swift.Hope in the future the service would be more quick and the app becomes more smoother without any lag and no payment issues.I would like to highlight one thing - Customer care call service is pathetic , it must be improved. 4 - 5 times I placed a call, one single guy took the call every time.He spoke in a regional language-hindi.I asked him to speak in english or give to someone who knows english so I can communicate easily.He refused and disconnected the call(after 2-3 attempts).First thing i guess there is insufficient people in the call service team since all the 4-5 times the same person spoke and second thing the person attending should sound polite or atleast sound professional.More than anything ""service"" is something important, which makes the customer visit again.If its not improved, then its difficult to sustain in the competitive environment.That too being from India's PROUD ""TATA"" brand, I wish to see this platform grow thousandfold and flourish successfully! So, please work on the customer service and improve the platform's issues/glitches that is present currently. from a RATAN TATA's Fan"
30,app,I did not have any interaction with your customer care today. I don't intend to have also... Very disappointing
30,app,"Worst shopping experience I have ever had. The customer service personnel are unable to resolve the issues. 10 days after making a successful transaction, there was no order ID. Tata Neu customer service people asked me to call Croma and Croma personnel said there is no such order ID. I asked customer service personnel to escalate the issue and asked for a new order to be placed as the transaction was successful, but they said it was beyond their purview. Pathetic and most harrowing experience. You guys need to go a long long way to be in competition with such careless customer service. God bless you. I am disappointed to see my favourite brand go this way. ??"
30,app,"Its about the app, you are trying to create all things in one place but its very complicated to find and purchase the things.. App is vibrating in every 10 second your tata cliq which is vibrating same. But my point is that your app is need to be easy to use."
30,app,It's more than 72hrs happen but my issue is not resolved as well 1st time Tata not in word
30,app,Worst service I applied for qik loan and collected all documents and approved. Rejected after one week
30,app,Not happy with service as i am still waiting for my disbursement of my loan for 10 days & still wait is not over yet
30,app,Not at all i m not happy
30,app,"Points not getting credited. Executives asking for invoice. When the transaction happened, i was told points would get credited automatically as my phone number is linked to Neu. I have not preserved the invoices. Didn't expect such a shoddy user experience from the Tatas."
30,app,"The reason I used this Tata NEO app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neo app."

30,app,Not happy
30,app,I will never use or recommend this app. Neu points still not credited and customer support is clueless.
30,app,You need to work on the app. i really had to struggle to reach my cart once i closed the app. good to have everything under one roof but a little updating is required because people who are not that tech savy will struggle to really look for things.
30,app,"It's messy, product search is different Between native app and neu. Product spread is also not good. I was searching for Titan zoop watches, only outdated and old models available in listing. Not at all a good experience"
30,app,I have done a recharge through Neu app and the amount was deducted from my account and its showing recharge was failed
30,app,"First you should do improve of your app,your app is working very slow"
30,app,"Unable to connect my credit card, followed all instruction of customer care but still they went on saying that profile is not updated. Eventually i deleted the app altogether"
30,app,I have explained that I donâ€™t want support but I want to address one bug or issue in your application and due to that tata neu is in loss and customer will get more benefits. So call me or provide me platform where I can address the issue and you can work on it and company can save money.
30,app,Very disappointed thinking this is TAj ?
30,app,Very reliable app
30,app,I cannot get proper information about my quick personal loan. Which is i applied before 5 days
30,app,Very bad experience.I ordered for 8 size shoes UK/India delivery was done size 10.5 UK/India.The complaint was made the same day .The return pickup boy said you have used the product hence refused return.How can I use your he bigger size.His behaviour was very rude who visited my premises.I felt very disappointed dealing with tataneu
30,app,"The air asia site and mobile app crashed and all entered details were lost thrice , the coupn code neupass10 wasnt working and later i was realised that it was working but not showing the discount. I lost 4k because of this whole misrepresntation and crash issues.Seems air asia wants us to book from other integrators.. the mobile site is not properly tested ."
30,app,No one called me. The app doesnâ€™t work. Pages donâ€™t open at all.
30,app,"Not sure , I have ordered Croma ac as part of flash deal label on Neu app which was later cancelled , as i felt cheated by Tataâ€™s . the same product was available on another 2 platform amazon and TataCLiQ with exactly same price and sold by croma with free standard installation. Whereas when I inquired at Neu chat support they told me I need to pay installation charges. When the seller is same , brand is company owned , you are labelling it under flash sale then why such discrepancies across channel. Never expected this kind of unethical practice from brand Tata"
30,app,Is app à¤®à¥‡à¤‚ Payment process difficult hai
30,app,12din ho gye loan apply kiye abhi tk kch nhi hua
30,app,"U have only option to chat with bot. I referred 2 family members, never got any points. Useless. Will stick with reliance apps."
30,app,TaTa neu app more update like pincode not dedecate accurately . 2 all the other side synchronization is not well 3 animation take more in mobile
30,app,The app and chat interface is really bad. I purchased a mobile and protection and even after raising complaints multiple times have not received either the invoice or any digital copying the protection . Besides 1. I canâ€™t get my invoice through the app 2. Chat agents randomly change in between and u have to explain everything again. Even after that they donâ€™t do anything to solve ur issue 3. Chat by itself is problematic. The agent asks u for an order number when u go to search the order the chat gets hidden and somehow u have to navigate to come back to chat 4. Even though it says one app for all.. every service has its own data and same info needs to be provided to each service 5. I gave an order on big basket and it had high delivery charge so I dint do payment . My order was still taken with a message that they converted my order to CoD. But worse part was when I tried to cancel the order it said I canâ€™t do it for 15 mins for god knows what reason. I let the person come and told him i donâ€™t want the order. Then the csr calls again saying agent is waiting on me. Itâ€™s so stupid the whole workflow Overall if someone can help at least the time my invoice and protection copy I will really appreciate ??
30,app,The problem is not with the customer service representative. Its the app that's the problem.
30,app,Rep Did not know about online payment on bigbasket. My neucoins still not reflecting even though I shopped via neupass app on bigbasket. Neupass slows down actual bigbasket app. App hangs any times.
30,app,There is lot of updates needed to be done in this app. Right now it's slow and lagging. And the upi payment needs very much time which feels irritating.
30,app,I have been applied quick personal loan before 6 days ago but no any amount credit in my bank account no any response to your executive.
30,app,All products are sold out every time in croma what should I buy no products in croma in croma site croma company coolers or not available old out may I can't see where the coolers of croma app
30,app,Nice app
30,app,Tata neu app is cheating its customers and not even refunding the amount they have deducted fraud APP
30,app,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
30,app,"But the app needs to be made faster and many features such as pay now for orders as available on bigbasket and Amazon r not available on tha app especially if the payment fail then one has to re order which is very irritating. If one makes search for one item in the app then the suggestion given in seating engine r not relevant There is no option for using other UPI payment which r available in Amazon, JioMart and Amazon. The app needs to be brought at par vis a vis Amazon, jii mart and infact bigbasket has all features and speed which is lacking when operated through Tata neu"
30,app,"The option to apply for emi card should be available for all , I seem to be not eligible"
30,app,"Issue is still not resolved as I placed order using Neu app only, but your customer care representative is repeatedly stating that order placed using bigbasket app."
30,app,Too many issues with the App. Should not have been launched. Moreover the resolution provided are designed in a way that the company is benefitted not the customer. Not at all a customer/ consumer centric app
30,app,Some bugs are present in app
30,app,After sanction the load it was not disbursed. And it takes too much time your and ours bcz we are regularly check the status and conclusion is waste of our time.i strongly recommend to developer to plz improve or stop the app .
30,app,"I was trying to purchase Voltas Magnum 1 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (4-in-1 Convertible, Copper Condenser, 123V through debit card to get the Rs3000 cashback offer. But every time I tried it would show as failed transaction so I contacted the customer helpdesk who couldn't provide any resolution to my problem. Hence dejectedly I had to place the offer using UPI method without using the Rs3000 offer. Ultimately I lost Rs3000. If you want to give an offer to your customers make sure it works before putting it on the application. Very disappointed."
30,app,"Lot of bugs while installing,most of my friends were not able to instal tata app, etc..."
30,app,They are not able to resolve simple issue. Very hopeless team. The feeling was worst when contacted on chat through app
30,app,I have apply ticket for return request but getting some error in that page so i have apply for cancellation i have raised a queey 1000 times but my query is not resolved .
30,app,Worst app doesn't had clarity on any thing stupid application useless fellows.
30,app,The application is yet to stabilise. Points for my stay at Taj Exotica Gia for stay in Mar - Apr are yet to be credited. This is despite numerous followups over almost a month
30,app,nice app good to use
30,app,Not happy at all as i m still waiting for disbursement of my loan amount after applyng on 14th April & all procedures completed by my side
30,app,"TATA NEU don't have many basic features like UPI payment option while ordering anything. Terms & conditions are not clearly mentioned fir neu coins. It's biggest confusing thing. App is so laggy. It takes some times more than 5-10 secs to open new page which irritates customer if we have many other smooth other alternative apps available. We are here only for the name of TATA. Don't ruin the name of TATA by making such bad product. It seems app was launched without any preparations & there is no common sense. How can you miss UPI payment option for orders, seriously?"
30,app,Very bad experience- transaction failure occurred but my money got debited- inspite of talking to customer care & mailing my concern no action was taken till today- even after 20 days i haven't got my money back- will never ever recommend this app in my life
30,app,This app still not giving good experience and most of time payment through tata pay is failing . Sometime items removed or added missing if we moved out app and logged in again .
30,app,"utter shit application.. cheated me...Transaction got failed and they told that cash will be refunded within 7 days... after 10days of transaction, it got successful.. I didn't get any refund... going to file a case in NCH"
30,app,No Proper FeedBack or Resolution to my Query Yet.Not Happy at All.Everything is Just Fictious here on the App
30,app,ITSM should be more knowledgable. And app have a lot of bugs
30,app,"Please improve your app, and please provide us seamless experience when we use the app. Now, at this time there are may bugs that we face in tata new app. Please solve and update your app as soon as possible."
30,app,"please do a thorough QAQC before getting the app into the public and groom and educate the customer care rep. thanks, as it's the trust in name of TATA being at stake."
30,app,Hi team Many time I filled the application but still not showing some error technical which not my fault and please change the background theme tata neu Still my concern not resolved
30,app,Paid it through the app but they r saying didnt do it ... It feels betrayed
30,app,"As long as the problem is not solved, app is of no use as it cannot be used"
30,app,very unstable app i lost money
30,app,I will never suggest any colleague or friend of mine aur relative of mine to use this pathetic app as in the entirement of aprilia have place three order and all these three order was deliver on time but I had to change a lot for the new coins also I have received you coins only for 2 orders and one order it was not given and I have give up now
30,app,"I had made a bill payment through the app but did not get any Neu Coins for it, and no one knows why or when I will get them."
30,app,No proper solution at tata neu app
30,app,"I am unable to add UPI to this app from long time and referred this app to my brother as well and he too have same issue from atleast a week but when I contacted support team person, he says me to wait for 24 hrs of time and then get a error screenshot and then he will escalate it to next level support teams. I feel it really disgusting. Instead of wasting that much of time, I could have used other UPI apps which I did. I have not uninstalled this app just because of one emotional reason and that reason is that its a TATA company's app. Thanks,"
30,app,"My issue stands unresolved. Neu has taken away one Mother Dairy Curd ordered on 28th April. Since then, I have spoken to Tata Neu and Bigbasket help line. Both were groping in the dark. Surprised to note that the good experience at the start turned out to be a nightmare. Issue is not the Curd or Rs. 47.25; it's the lack of coordination and problem solving. The delivery boy said that the item was spoilt/ bad. So refund would be initiated. Wonder! How the new app can be botched up by some, so soon. Not in conformity with Tata experience!!!!"
30,app,"Very slow peocessing and time wasting App. I purchased Voltas 1.5 ton AC deivered on18 Apr 22 and delayed installed on 24 Apr 22. After installation 1 day AC stop cooling and error occured 5d & 6E. I register complaint on daily to daily min 5 time with croma cust care but till 02 May no technician visit at my house and till AC is off road/not working. Very bad experience with Croma, Voltas & Tata neu app. Waste my time, waste my money....."
30,app,CS guys objective is to earn credits on responses â€¦ they donâ€™t go depth to understand whatâ€™s the issue w.r.T the new app tataneu. Look at the CS responses â€¦.. but if you go through smart basket then services available in our are if go through Grocery menu services not available in our are. This issue they never understood & still persists.
30,app,The issue stands unresolved. The customer service team is pathetic with zero capability of understanding the issue. 5% cashback neucoins promised for watches and is still being displayed in the application; the same not credited to my account yet. Zero resolution with fake promises and advertisement (email already sent with the screen shot showing 5% cashback is eligible).
30,app,Very poor service and completely disappointing form a Tata Group company
30,app,The issue is not yet resolved. None of the BigBasket Neucoins are reflecting in app. Please resolve the issue before requesting feedback.
30,app,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
30,app,Simply superb experience. I love free shipping and new coins systems. Honestly it is indeed a super app. One stop solution for anything and everything.
30,app,Truly a superb app.
30,app,I am unble to use this application on my mobile
30,app,"The app itself needs little improvement as it takes time to load, otherwise all good."
30,app,Pathetic service. Will never order anything from neu app.
30,app,Babut bekar log hai. Koi kuch bolata hai koi kuch. Fake application hai ye
30,app,Had too much issues with the app regarding payment processing and coupons. Prices went up. Customer executives were unable and unwilling to helpz
30,app,This app is very useful in life All rounder in India Super coustomer care services All the best
30,app,Asked for more clarification. Don't have enough time to explain the details. make the app better to raise issues or store screenshot s
30,app,I had used tata neu while placing bigbasket order. But still the customer care executive is saying that i had placed order on bigbasket app.. So they are not giving rewards.
30,app,Agent gave me all the required information. Very happy!
30,app,Concern still not resolved after 14 days. Planning to utilise Neu coins and uninstall app for good
30,app,One of the best app and platform in the India. And it is very very halp us with fainancely. tatapay is not working at this time but I think as son as it will be working. Thank you tata.?
30,app,"I wish I could edit the fields myself. I am still seeing a PIN Code of 400001 when I open the App though my address is shown as 500028. I want to see my correct location of 500028 when I open the App. I also did not get a resolution of the request raised to BigBasket and that I mentioned to you. Since yours is a Super App and is supposed to integrate all the Tata apps, I expect you to coordinate and resolve the issues of the individual Tata Apps like BigBasket also."
30,app,I had to repeat my ask a few times despite being on chat and clearly mentioned what the request was for. The matter was not understood despite spending more than required time for the query. Ultimately I had to end the call as I had to attend to something else. The responses need to be prompt and knowledgeable especially if the query was simple - I have multiple accounts with various Tata services. Some with same mobile/email and couple with another. the purpose of super app is to combine all together and it shouldnt be so hard to attend to that request! Presume the idea for the super app is to benefit the customer and hence the Tata Group
30,app,I have not received any call from customer service representative. I am trouble to understand Tata neu app features. How it's work ?
30,app,I am not satisfied by either your customer care executive and your apps overall performance so below average
30,app,Neu needs dynamic app to offer best price from all Tata platforms/Apps
30,app,"TataNeu app is not up to the mark. I don't even get the promised loyalty rewards (coins). Compared to your app, Amazon should be given 5 stars. (Here I must state that I hold shares in Tata companies - Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Teleservice - and I hope your app does well. )"
30,app,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
30,app,"There are many glitches in the app. Like TATA pay section never work and always crashes the app. PIN code section on home page, just on the right side of search bar, when we tap it shows some error. And i am unable to add my credit card it always shows. 'We are unable to add cards. Try again later. '"
30,app,0 Star reting not Solve issue Financial Support bekar Email bheja kuch ata nahei salo Pura Email thik se bhejo not interested Your app bekar service
30,app,The app is not working on my iphone 11 pro maxâ€¦totally disappointed
30,app,"Ordered AC, it's was delivered in 2 days but not updated as delivered so installation technician didn't turn up unless I complain over app"
30,app,There is a requirement of app updation because it's quite slow and more features should be added
30,app,It was a very disappointing experience. Money debited from my account. And delivery boy asking for cash. No call back from senior inspite of request.Then money credited back next day. Total waste of a Sunday Morning. And a very bad feel about the Neu.
30,app,Loan approved and got disbursed but haven't received yet in more than 2 days
30,app,I will never recommend this app . It is the worst app I ever have because it is not user friendly and very complicated .
30,app,"I Chat Daily on Your Customer Care Chat Section regarding The Ac, Ac is Delivered but today is 2 days Passed And Installation is not yet done. Also app shows me your Ac is installed, But this is Totally Wrong because Ac is not installed, I am daily Chat and they said ""please wait for 3 Days. Keep In mind if you want to be a big brand than improve your service otherwise customer switch to Amazon, Because Amazon Fulfill Ac installation in 24 hours from delivery of products. Also Your Croma Helpline is not Working, â˜¹ï¸"
30,app,The ticket resolution has not happened. My big basket points are still not visible.
30,app,My one bill of croma is not showing in my record of 25 april. so your representative told me to remove the app and reinstall it. i dont think that is a solution
30,app,Overall are not currently sot out my problem I'm not happy to say
30,app,"When you have a promotion of 10% nue coins being run, then why only 5% are credited and again I need to request again for the second time. This has happened for 2 orders till now and still extra 5% are not credited yet."
30,app,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
30,app,"I installed this app, and when I wanted to make a transaction (around â‚¹9,500) at Westside it rejected, imposing a limit of â‚¹5,000. If I am making a transaction then it isn't upto you whether I will perform a transaction of lesser amount. When I contacted customer care to provide necessary neu points they straight away rejected, stating that this is an offline transaction. Then I did another transaction of â‚¹700 in Croma, the app straight away gave an error. What's the point of using this app where I cannot get neu points and the transaction doesn't succeed. Sorry but I am not going to use this customer unfriendly app."
30,app,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
30,app,I wonâ€™t recommend to my frnds this app because the app have lot of bugs and it is not snappier
30,app,"I applied for personal loan 11 days back,i am regularly follow up through what's up, every time I follow up simply one and only one answer i received, please wait sir or reslove in 3 working days,i don't expect this kind of answer from tata group,i thank you"
30,app,"I stayed in TAJ Bengal on 20th and 21st April'22. The booking was done through TAJ Website , using my Inner Circle Membership no. I wrote a mail with scanned copies of the bill on 2nd May. Till date the points has Not been Credited to my account and i received a mail that it would take 10 to 15 woking days starting May,2nd for the Credit to happen. Such huge delay is not Good service by any standard,"
30,app,Very disappointed as my order still not showing anywhere.
30,app,No customer service All is just stupid time Neu app is blunder in disguise
30,app,I have not got the solution. How do you expect me to rate your services. I did everything that was told but the app is not working in my phone.
30,app,Where is my neu coins . I purchased through tata neu app rs 2k but I didn't receive neu coin
30,app,Need to understand what i am trying to say; otherwise need to speak to me if not able to understand. I mentioned when i placed the order for bigbasket through Neu app the option to select vouchers where i get instant discount is not showing. Hence i lost 5% of new coins which i was supposed to receive.
30,app,Customer care executive was not knowing about Big Basket promotional offer. You can read all the details in whats app chat.
30,app,"No one know whats happening, no idea where the order is placed, if i need to puck up or will the product be delivered, your website shows ready for pickup, i opted for delivery, customer service wanted me to pick up from store, i got a call from delivery executive that he is out for delivery but not delivered. I cancelled order after delivery window is completed. I will never come back to TATA Or Crome."
30,app,"Your support and application are not upto mark, you have to improve alot to sustain in Indian market ( I have always wished that the app always sustains as it is an indigenous app) where we have the best ecommerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart & providing world class services"
30,app,"Hello Team, I am really disappointed by the way i was treated being member for more than 5 years with TAJ. I was given false information by the executive Lavina and changed her statement. I need to have a decision which is true and very much neutral."
30,app,No points have been credited for any of my transactions done on this app. The app is a huge disappointment.
30,app,"It is disappointing to see Tata not walking the talk when it comes to credit of Neu coins. I had spent ~42k exclusive of taxes on a booking in IHCL. As per the advertisement, I should have received 5% of the credit in terms of Neu coins. I only got 1368 neu coins against 2100 going by simple math."
30,app,"Very poor, extremely unhappy with service and resolution of compliant"
30,app,Pls start cash on delivery in croma ....... Rest it is superb.....nice app
30,app,I ordered From online croma Store & i selected picup from store Thane kapurbawadi store but customer service desk person saying I'm not giving you order very disappoint from Thane kapurbawadi store
30,app,"The app has picked up data without verifying it. The name taken is my organisation's name. The phone and membership is in my name. to update the name, you ask me documents! Did you take my consent while updating the data? are you trying to make life easy for customers or complicated?"
30,app,"Though customer care or sales executives are good, the app and interface for online shopping at Neu leaves much to be improved"
30,app,I have been given a TATA Qik EMI card which has a limit of 100000 but is not showing up as a payment option when I try to shop in the Croma website through the app. I dont see a point of having a card with limit when I can use it
30,app,"Main tata neu app to kabhi bhi kisi fnds ko suggest nahi karne wala, gaali hi"
30,app,My order was supposed to be delivered by 2/may/2022. I still have not received it despite on continuous followups with customer care. I was promised by croma team my order would be delivered by 3/May/2022 and nothing happened. I received call today from Bluedart couriers and they said order will be delivered today (5/may/2022) and it still is not delivered. I was not being informed about delay in my order which is highly unsatisfactory. Had to multiple follow ups to get above info. Customer care representative was not able to provide me â€œgrievance email idâ€. Overall experience has been very bad and i wont be ordering anything from Tata Neu in future. In the age where you get groceries delivered in hours a Big brand like Tata is not able to deliver my order is simply unacceptable.
30,app,Very disappointment with tata neu app. Even customer service person was clueless. Food was delivered cold. Not a good experience
30,app,Very worst app
30,app,Good app and service. Perks provided should continue and not stop after some time
30,app,Waited for almost a week for refund off items I didn't receive and had paid for. Also app could be easier to use and less laggy
30,app,I had complained that I am unable to deregister my UPI from Tata neu app and the issue hasn't been resolved.
30,app,"I wanted to.merge two neu accounts into one. They said they could do it, but despite several emails they have not been able to do it. Very disappointed."
30,app,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
30,app,Still waiting for disbursement of my loan which i hv apply on 14th April
30,app,Some of the features are not yet refined. Moreover kindly provide all the caveats somewhere in the app so that people are aware of what they are signing for.
30,app,"many things aren't available like Wallet(money wallet for payment directly), Books special for the students etc. offers for money transfer, pay bills(please include all the types things- LPG cylinder also) similar like Amazon app facilities"
30,app,Ticket raised by 1 week regarding for qik personal technical error..they dont know how to resolve...simply wait for 72 hrs...disappointed...
30,app,No body has called yet. Didn't get appropriate response by mail. Very much upset.
30,app,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."
30,app,"I was applied a quik digital PERSONAL LOAN My all KYC are Done and ECS ENACH HAS ALSO DONE But I donâ€™t Received a LOAN AMOUNT AND LOAN SANCTION LETTER ,, tata neu customer care has been not helping me not giving any details and update about Loan"
30,app,"What they said is wait, I made a txn on 13th April which got failed, i didn't get any refund till today, contacted you via app,chat, mail, also in twitter. Still what u reply ""wait for some time"" it's been 3weeks"
30,app,I had used big basket for fruits and vegetables. They are supposed to be fresh. Was delivered to me 3-4 days later than promised. No help from anyone. No intimation. Not reliable at all. Really disappointing. Biggest problem is there is no one to reach out to...
30,app,My Problem was not solved. Im still not able to order on Big Basket through Neu app
30,app,Totally sluggish app with full of bugs
30,app,"I requested for call to explain my concern, however did not receive any call from any representitive. Also, i was not able to use theAirasia App and flight booking tab completely. In addition , my hotel booking details were not available, it was asking the booking referance ...i was expcting my bookings to appear in the app, when i login to my app using my credentials.."

In addition , my hotel booking details were not available, it was asking the booking referance ...i was expcting my bookings to appear in the app, when i login to my app using my credentials.."
30,app,Worst app
30,app,No use this app
30,app,Disappointed
30,app,app interface is so bad and everything so lagging and app features don't work properly
30,app,He didn't do what i asked him to do. Kindly contact me ASAP I'm having issues with the app
30,app,Very bad nothing is happening
30,app,"Really Disappointed with such a huge brand that it has not been able to resolve such a simple query, completely at loss of words"
30,app,"Worst customer care service, better close your app waste customer time money"
30,app,I was told i will get someone call me and the resolution but that hasn't happened i have lost all hopes with the TATA BRAND
30,app,App not propar working my order done payment is done but not received order 5 days after complen so refunded my money but I haw product required so I haw not happy and offer my product is not show
30,app,Bad interface. Order could not get completed. Chat assist us very slow and customer care representative disappears and gives standard answer which is otherwise available online. The UI of the app is very poor and overall app experience is not that great.
30,app,I was ordered some medicines from Tata Neo app but there is a mistake in a delivery I was order for the tablet Voglimit 0.3 25 strips 24 strips are correct but one is Voglikem 0.3 so please try to replace this regards thank you Anil pahuja
30,app,Arrogance to be avoided while dealing with customers. Not at all happy the way in which query was handled.
30,app,With the kind of cheap tricks you played giving nuecoins i was better off uninstalling the app
30,app,"Talking about TATA neu, one can say it's successful only if the below conditions are met: 1. Most of your products are undeliverable outside metro cities and so far after raising so many concerns nothing being done. So why would I buy 1 product with TATA and others look for somewhere. 2. Though bringing of all the items under TATA was good through Neu, there are many products missing from the online store. I would suggest all the products to be run on a single app other than using 1mg, Croma or a TATA cliq."
30,app,My lone application 7day old last step not working error already 3 time compliment not update customer service
30,app,Yet to understand your app!
30,app,"I have place Symphony cooler on tata neu app, it was not showing under my order section. I called customer care thrice and they confirmed that they have received my order request and suddenly I got order cancellation email from tata Croma the day I was waiting for my product to be delivered. Is this a joke going on."
30,app,Very slow application. Bill payment option please increase.
30,app,I'm not happy bcz my personal loan not ad my account
30,app,I have been using big basket and 1mg for a long time and have bb star and diabetic care plans. Since the very start the Tata Neu is very buggy platform. Initially the payments didnâ€™t go through and I was forced to complete payment at bigbasket app. Now for several days I have been facing several issues like coins not credited to account and the resolution time is very long. Secondly the customer service is clueless they just do not understand the issue even after mailing proper order no. and transaction no. Still they are unable to resolve the issue.
30,app,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
30,app,Amount deducted from my account and order was not placed. After raising same issue several time i am not able to get my money back even after almost a month. Query is always getting resolved without actually resolving it. Very bad customer support and will not recommend any one to use this app again.
30,app,"The app is in developing stage and certain hiccups unavoidable.thus i would stick to it with expecting it to be near its potential. However customer support need to be more responsive, responsible and realistic about resolving the issues."
30,app,Lot of bugs in the app. Booked through app on big basket. App did not credit 5% as advertised. Only 3 points were credited. Custoer service mentioned it was booked from big basket app
30,app,Very poor app and the systems for customer redressal are bad. My cashback is yet to be credited and I haven't heard from any of your representatives
30,app,"The process to credit NeuCoins to orders is not working properly. Automatic credit of Neucoins is not happening forcing me to raise the concern through your chat. I had complained twice and once it got resolved The second complaint is still waiting for resolution. The chatbot does not recognise the order numbers, forcing us to wait for an agent. The agents take their own time, leaving us to wait on them. If I do not respond fast enough, they disconnect. It is completely one sided transaction, with no concern for the customer."
30,app,Customer service is very good but you guys need to improve a lot on the app User interface. Not at all convenient and User friendly
30,app,The app is absolute failure
30,app,Not happy at all with you people as you people are hopeless and helpless go to hell.
30,app,The worst app i have ever seen
30,app,The Matter is still pending and the ticket (Ticket ID-954426) shows the status of resolve. The customer care is asking me to show Screenshot of error but in Tata pay app do not allow to take screenshot. Its my humble request to look after the matter and resolve the same ASAP
30,app,Not received invoice for my last order through tata neu app. Very slow app. Doesn't work properly
30,app,"Banks for loan repayment are limited. Most of government servants have salary account in Govt banks but some govt banks are missing from your list (e.g. Bank of India). So most of the central govt employees are not able to take loan from your app and they have to go to other apps like Kreditbee, MoneyTap, MoneyView, EarlySalary, Walnut etc. etc. the list is to long."
30,app,"Almost a month has passed since the money has been debited but there are no signs of issuing refund, concern is every time i ask support they are just escalating but nothing else is happening and if it is i m not aware of anything...there is no call support option as well"
30,app,I'm sorry to inform you that when I am going to tap on TATA PAY suddenly the app was closed. So I link my bank account by tap on sending money but I am unable to open TATA PAY.
30,app,sales executive attend the customer fraction of seconds they diaspper till they arrive customer has to wait. regarding the product explanation its ok. customer has to stand in showroom atleast some sitting arrangement has to be done. as i said sales executive attends and disapper .installation people are good
30,app,I apply for lone last 7 days ago dt 2/5/22 but noy approval my lone
30,app,Very disappointing to be informed that a refund process would be initiated in 3 - 5 working days for a legitimate request . Best part is that after 3 days the process is yet not initiated as can be seen from the app.
30,app,"I don't have any issue with customer care but my concern is for Croma. First time i received defective piece (someone used piece), so initiated return and second time ordered same piece but this time damaged parcel ( with opened condition there is no thermocol on bottom ). When I requested for immediate new piece in another 72 hrs there is no ownership at all. Based on this personal experience strongly not recommended for anyone else. Many things has to be improved quality, customer care ownership, application is very slow, order tracking not up to date ( portal got updated after 2 days once product delivered)."
30,app,"We are unable to Register on the app. As per reply recd, the problem has been resolved but the same is still pending."
30,app,"The application feels sluggish, I used Big basket inside the app UI feels compromised."
30,app,I havenâ€™t received Nue points yet for my purchases using Nue app on 09-Apr-2022.
30,app,Just only speed up my neu apps Wolk Lil slowly..
30,app,"Even writing for 5 times, 10% neu coins on order on bisbsket through tata neu app, neu coins not credited. Last order, even 5% coins not given ."
30,app,"I use this app for first time. I was using for prepaid mobile recharge. 1. I add my upi in this app, but can't use upi for payment. 2. I add paytm bank debit card for payment but can't paid by it 3. I add Axis bank card again for payment and after trying 3 time my balance is deducted but recharge is not done. 4. I can't cancel my transaction, as per customer care executive I have to wait for 24 hrs to see whether my transaction will be successful or declined. I want to give 0 if there is option."
30,app,I have got approved everything is dont but till now did not received any sanction letter also my problem is not yet resolve need the solution asp
30,app,Disappointed
30,app,Fully disappointed
30,app,The app is not somewhat user-friendly
30,app,Arrogant customer care agent. Very indifferent. Plus rigid policies. Basic things which must be done through app generally need calls etc and is a waste of time. Very unfriendly UI. Cannot recommend Tata Neu to anyone in this current form. I trusted Tata brand and tried but very disappointed.
30,app,Pathetic service and responses.. Its been a week now and I have no clue about the refund. I canceled the delivery but never got any email or text about the cancelation. I may approach consumer court if not refunded
30,app,The app has my default address but still asks me for my address and doesn't let me register it
30,app,One of the worst app
30,app,I didnt get any response / call for the issue which i raised. Very disappointed.
30,app,Delivery of food must be in time. Delay leads to disappointment. Tickets raised must be resolved same day.
30,app,Response to my questions was no way related to queries raised. It was not of any use in understanding application better. Still not able to clear my doubts.
30,app,See the number of open tickets in my tata neu app
30,app,never subscribed or register to your app from ppbahndari@mmnissim.com
30,app,Not happy
30,app,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
30,app,This app is very good
30,app,I am very happy with my experience with Tata Neu so far.
30,app,My problem remains. Further If I go Bigbasket thru your neu app it says we are not serving your area but thru Bigbasket I am placing order from many years.
30,app,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
30,app,I applyed for qik loan but its taking long time im waiting fir help very urgent
30,app,Poor app. Very slow. Payment not easy on the app. Tata pay never works. Not easy navigating the app. Customer care only trained to give standard generic reply. Long was to go before you can compete with rivals.
30,app,I can't recommend anyone about your app until my problem is solved.
30,app,Delivery to be given between 4-8 pm for grocery was given at 11.30 pm . You want customer to wake up to take deliveries. Delivery partner should have called and informed . When asked for postponing delivery was asked to cancel the delivery and had to reorder each item again since your app does not have reorder previous items facility.
30,app,Simple question - For orders above 1200 on grocery - 10% Neu coins - when is credit made? Why not same credit criteria on BB app using TATA pay
30,app,Strongly recommend very Bad service 9 dayes wait for loan not disburse in my account..wrost app Tata neu
30,app,Kitani baar mail bheju bhot wrost app he loan wait for 9 days but not disburse my account...
30,app,Not happy with your service
30,app,"The people should have the empowerment to resolve small issues. I didn't know that I got neu points only if i went thro the app n hence felt cheated /bad when I purchased directly from big basket . It was an error n i expected a one time resolution in my favour by giving me those points . That was what a Tata Taj employee would have done , which i am used to but you people didn't, hence unhappy . You can still resolve it amicably by adding around 30 points , that's all or keep an unsatisfied customer , u decide"
30,app,Payment will not be made by transaction history is a disappointed feature..i expect clear simple interface..i feel it's little bit cluster..neu app is bit slow compare to Paytm app...
30,app,Very disappoint not properly support not my query solve
30,app,"Your app is very slow and lots of bugs ,please update your app ."
30,app,Fake app
30,app,Worst service even customer care canâ€™t know whatâ€™s the issue .. & they will tell you will get a call .. but never it happen . Shame on you ratan Tata & CEO N Chandrasekarn ?
30,app,Too worst app and portal
30,app,"I didn't need to interact with your CSR. But overall my experience was very positive, except the fact that the Neu app is comparatively slower and somewhat difficult while moving to another app from within."
30,app,I am waiting for installation of 1 tonne Hitachi ac since 8rth may .it has not been installed till now.no technician has arrived to take up job .I am very disappointed by service.
30,app,Not at all happy with the service by the tata neu team. They are not at all helping and have not resolved my problem after many many followups.
30,app,"in an order of fruits, 3 fruits were not delivered, app also shows that fruits not delivered, no refund, no coins. Simply deliver the fruits but NO, multiple tickets are created and things are raised to new levels but nothing happens. JUST DELIVER THE MISSING FRUITS AS PER YOUR ORDER"
30,app,I ordered via nue application and my coins were not given even after sharing order details. Very bad customer service. Why you closed the issue without any solution. This is cheating from Tatas.
30,app,need improvement. Lots of work to be done. I believe the app is launched way too soon just because of IPL.
30,app,I have not received the product and it is shown as delivered no customer care no. Available. Bad experience. No option of complaint on the app. Only exchange option. Bad user interface. Bad experience will not rdcommend to anybody.
30,app,Hopeless app with no inclination to resolve customer concerns
30,app,I am very disappointed to tata neo
30,app,App was to hang /stuck issues and one most things is that card logo or option if a person has kept or not any product any his her card it's has to be show as other app
30,app,It's a pretty useless reward system vis a vis the amount spent. Also my query was on payment via Neu coins which the executive told me could only be through the Neu app and not Big Basket app - which was incorrect as I was able to link my Neu wallet to my Big Basket app
30,app,The endless wait when the customer service agent disappears from an online chat is not only painful but also unprofessional
30,app,"Worst app ever in market, not working well. It's been one month UPI payment failed and refund isn't done. Deleting this app. ?"
30,app,"Excellent customer Services in Nagpur city Maharashtra state with single apps providing many services include Big basket, Airlines flight âœˆï¸ tickets, etc"
30,app,It would be nice if I only can include my middle name on the app. The blank was not there when I signed up . Thanks
30,app,Crap app and bad support.
30,app,customer service is crapp.. really disappointed.. I will never ever use and suggest this app to anyone
30,app,Although the customer service agent was good the problem of not getting the neucoin credit was not resolved. I just got a response that I will not be given credit just because one system has my middle name and the other did not. This is completely unprofessional and i am very unhappy about the way this was handled.
30,app,Iam trying to apply wok loan but unable to complete due to technical error.but they are not solved this issue.please try to sole the issue
30,app,I applied qik loan about 15 days ago but still not received yet when I call customer care they saying wait for 48 hours repeated
30,app,"It is most disappointing that after 3 calls / chats, my concern is not resolved and I have to keep following up for a paltry sum of Rs 225/ after 8 days of the matter being raised"
30,app,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
30,app,"The service is extremely pathetic, due to technical glitch of an app wrong product got delivered and no body is addressing the issue."
30,app,Every thing excellent but call promised same that not happen
30,app,"App captures wrong data, change process is pathetic experience, need much more improvement. I uninstalled app"
30,app,First i have approve the limit of qik card after 1 month saying you have reject the services is it Horrible
30,app,I have uninstalled app
30,app,"I will never recommend this app to anyone. Been part of Tata family once, itâ€™s a shame that this has â€œTataâ€ brand in it."
30,app,"Some of the features planned are good specially consolidated bill payment, rewarding / loyalty points etc. Too early to recommend, there seems to be lot of teething issues and application performance needs to be improve ( ordering happened after 3 attempts)"
30,app,complaint was not attended. I had ordered via tata nue app. No coins were given. Exited application.
30,app,App slow browsing but app is good
30,app,Worst app
30,app,I uninstalled app
30,app,I raise a personal loan application 6th may 22 but still today they continued say gives more time. 5 times raise ticket but still no resolutions
30,app,I have uninstalled app
30,app,Nice app and specially coins benefit extremely good
30,app,Very bad apps my order is 01/05/2022 . My account to pay.2834.10. my order decline my payment is not refund in 14 day very bad Tata NeuCroma team
30,app,"Me being the TCS employee, I feel really disappointed for using tata Neu and also feeling bad for recommending it to my friends. I reached out to tata neu chat support and twitter support as I didnt get the neu coins for the product I purchased from croma store on May 6th (Invoice:SLA095001514772). Almost 10 days. no point in reaching out to customer care. I dare how they send for customer service feedback without resolving the issue."
30,app,The app experience could be improved. It is very slow.
30,app,"The app doesnt function as expected. my tata play isnt working for the past 1 week , Query has been resolved marked even though it is still pending"
30,app,Bigbazar is bringing bad name to Tata and Tataneu app needs lot of improvement.
30,app,I had no interaction with customer care today . Hence your mail is frivolous. The only reason for recommending the app to others would be loyalty to group company .
30,app,I can't change the name on the app
30,app,They wanted my ID proof to correct my name in app
30,app,It is more than 15 days money not yet refunded to me.....i am really disappointing
30,app,"I am so disappointed, response time which your team taking is too long while chatting"
30,app,CC executive was so lazy and have not proper knowledge about the app. Also she was unable to resolve my issue for my very first bill payment through TataNeu app. Still my bill is not credited to my merchant's account.
30,app,"Agent didn't have much information about where the product was avaliable, however I found it in Tata Cliq app."
30,app,"customer service call was having a annoying background system generated tone the product order was not cancelled by me but it was told so and shown in message via mail no body bothers to verify why it was cancelled the refund is very slow the app big basket and neu looks nothing as compared to amazon, i dont know why i decided to choose TATA instead for regular AMAZON ORDERS this is half ready product with lots of bugs"
30,app,"Customer care executive in chat was not having clarity, informed me to confirm order number, but with the order number only chat was selcted. I informed that, if I move out from chat to check order number, ongoing chat will be lost, but I was insisted to mention order number. I went back in app to view order number, ongoing chat was lost and same could not be traced back. Overall a frustrating experience. Take immediate corrective actions"
30,app,"I did not receive 5% neu coins after ordering grocery worth 850 from tata neu app. Customer care told â€˜Sir there is nothing we can do about this, our system is showing you did not order from tata neuâ€™ This is the resolution I received Good luck to tata neu team."
30,app,How to get in touch with customer care.the Tata cliq app does not have any facility. My return pickup of globus kurti is being unattended by the delivery executive.Not a single call received till date Also my calls are unanswered.
30,app,For a return pick up I am still struggling a lot since many days. After many follow-up it's taken place on 14th but yet not updated in app. Surprisingly I am still getting calls that pick up person is coming today to collect. Over phone chat and mail different versions no coordination no integration. Sadly
30,app,I have uninstalled app
30,app,I have contacted customer care a few times to change my profile name which comes across all my Tata apps. So far all agents promised the change would be made within 24-48 hours but it never happened. How did my profile name get someone else's name and why can I not change it?
30,app,"Wanted to make a booking at bjopal through app, but not able to make so. Instead opted MMT to book taj lakefront bhopal"
30,app,Pathetic service by customer care and the worst app that i have ever used.
30,app,Pathetic service by customer care and the worst app i have ever used. You guys are wasting my time since last 2 weeks just for INR 250
30,app,You people are cheaters. I lost my 278 neu coins... You people not value your customers. I requested a lot many times to provide my coins but you people did not. I quit here. I am not going to use your app further. I will use pharmeasy for my orders.
30,app,There is no reply even there is not any solution very third class app
30,app,Please call me on 9820002594...inspite of sending many mailsmy tata neu app has not been rectified of the issue i have stated
30,app,Customer care team did not apply their mind to resolve the issue. It looks like they are sticking to the given script rather than solving the issue. I have not received Neucoins for the transaction with Air Asia apparently because one system takes into account middle name while the other does not. This is a very bad way of textual comparison. Even the government agencies understand this and it was never expected of a Tata company.
30,app,Fuck your app i will never shop here again clowns
30,app,pathetic service. even a return pickup is not happening in more than 15 days.
30,app,This app working well but sometimes it take much time to load and work slowly.
30,app,"please solved my issue. Dear sir, I have purchased the V-Gaurd Voltage stabiliser model VG-400 from TATA Neu app and then go through Croma on 15 may 2022. Till now my order is not shown in the TATA Neu app nor Croma. I am not sure if it will be ordered or not. i was purchased it urgently as its show delivery date is 19 may2022. Only translation details are shown in the TATA NEU app and the same is complained in TATA NEU and croma also but no response. with Regards SKMishra 9926094937/7987046120"
30,app,Very disappointed with the service provided one complain not resolved for more than 17 day.
30,app,"The issue was around Tata 1mg cash. I had 256 1mg cash, which reduced to just 25 neucoins after migration !!!!!! When I asked the cust care representative Abinav Silam where the 231 coins disappeared, there was no proper answer. The call went on for 1.5 hours. Initially, the rep was highly adamant on me answering only specific security questions which were not necessary. I answere correctly 3 security questions but he kept asking more questions. Finally, no convincing solution - I am still wondering where my 1mgcash or neucoins disappeared. Some had expiry in July 2022. I will NEVER order on Tata 1mg again as they cheated me. Tata 1mg or Tata Digital does not respect customers."
30,app,"As this is a new app, on every transaction people should get Neu Coins, however, it only gave Neu Coins on purchasing, which were bit costlier as compared to other sites, not satisfied at all"
30,app,Worst app and worst service I had done booking in taj hotel through it but donâ€™t get any Tata Neu points.worst experience
30,app,The whole team at Tata Neu has no understanding of the amalgamation of all the Tata brands into one format and app .
30,app,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
30,app,Amazon jaisa aapka app customers ko support nahi karata bahut dikkat deta hai eslia maine app uninstall kiya
30,app,My simple concern was to Change my Name as it was incorrect and taken automatically by the app. I have no idea how an application takes false name automatically. It was very simple query that can be addressed easily by the huge firm like Tata. But I had to delete all my tata accounts for this issue. How bad can an application be. Pathetic experience. Poor support and bad experience with Tata Neu.
30,app,Still exploring the app.
30,app,"Please get rid of the bug, which cause things to be left unattended for six months. Plus the attitude is not very tata like. Even the head of the digital app, did not give a response which is line with the way TATA's look at customer centricity. The only person who said would take ownership was someone called Shubha Rani. Though her role in bringing an end to an issue which was pending for three months is not clear. Also when the ticket communication is sent to the customer, it really pained me to see words like customer is Irate. why would I not be irate? The neu team debited my card, but did not make the booking, did not communicate despite me raising the issue on time. There was no context given to the middle teams. I have spoken to atleast 25 people form the team and spent endless hours which I could have devoted to more productive activities, All in all TATA neu app sucks, is slow, if something goes sideways no one takes responsibility and run around like headless chickens. Or do not offer the resolution one needs. IF you are creating a payment portal, at least ensure governance, and try to help the customer. This feedback is certainly not the last you will hear from me."
30,app,Customer care has no clue about timelines and has very bureaucratic approach. Just focus on forwarding complaints. Back end not integrated - Neu and brand do not talk to each other
30,app,Not perfect app for searching
30,app,CSR are absolutely clueless....all they do is that they will escalate the problem to the technical team and ask for 72 hours more....they do this repeatedly....the app is pathetic and full of glitches.
30,app,"Just giving temporary assurance and actually not resolving the complaint is not enough (my personal experience regarding CROMA), you really have to work towards improving customer care. Not to ignore that there are alot of technical problems in TATA NEU app. TATA Pay : Once it showed that UPI payment was failed...But actually bank SMS was telling transaction was successful and receiver had got that amount... Since that day I stopped using TATA PAY... Also improve the transaction receipt which was shown at end of successful UPI payment... Bcoz receiver gets confused by the current receipt. I Hope more changes and improvements will be made in future..."
30,app,Issue is being postponed giving assurances to be resolved soon but nothing happens and no one bothers to calls back as a courtesy.
30,app,"I still have a problem with booking taj mahal tower room through TataNeu offer from taj site/app, TataNeu app for 11th june. i have tried numerous calls and emails to both taj and tataNeu, but havent got the solution yet. i have been trying to book since last 5 days. I am quite frustated at this point. Whenever i try to book, the page keeps on loading. i have given up at this point. from the first day i have been getting the same answer â€˜technical team is working on itâ€™ everyone just keeps forwarding the call to another person and the cycle repeats. i still dont have a solution for the problem faced."
30,app,Really now i am very happy...i got now solution...
30,app,"The worst app I have ever come across.. they donâ€™t give your money back , plz donâ€™t shop from this app"
30,app,1. Query not resolved 2. Chat in tata neu is very slow. In fact app is slow 3. Cust service guy doesnt tespond for minutes.
30,app,I have uninstalled app
30,app,"Since last 2 day I , I am facing trouble to cancel my order.. there is no customer support team, cancellation of product is not available on the tata neu application."
30,app,I applied for loan on 8th of May 2022 and my all verification and sanction letter was send to me on same date but amount didn't received yet.
30,app,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
30,app,I am not happy with your services becouse already 8 days has been completed but still no resolution
30,app,Still waiting for my order to be delivered.. highly disappointed .. TATA is known for there customer satisfaction but you guys puting down their image.. no one is there to help
30,app,"Please update the Neu app, it's too laggy and heavy app."
30,app,"Horrible. Very glitchy app, poor customer service and 2015-era delivery timelines. I ordered an iPhone 13 on 14 th May and it hasnâ€™t got delivered even on 20th. There is no way to cancel the order or talk to a customer service agent who can help"
30,app,The application is very complicated and not at all smooth
30,app,"Every thing they resolve, But they told my 75 New point will not expire it will back. that not happen."
30,app,"You may need to have strong linkage between your own group of companies for a seamless operation. Your app is not at all user friendly; check with Amazon, Flipkart, snapdeal and with your own Big Busket. You need to improve a lot to prove NEU as super app. Thanks"
30,app,you can call me for the feedback if you really want to know why I'm terribly disappointed
30,app,"I have applied for a PL through Tata Neu Qik Loan for INR 1,90,000 for 36 months, on 12th May. The digital KYC system was down and I opted for physical KYC collection. No one has come to collect those documents, nor called me. I raised a ticket, numbered, 1017592, last week. I have been following up with customer service, but all I am getting are empty promises to solve this issue within 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Nothing has happened so far! Please solve this issue. I need the funds at the earliest. My son has surgery on 10th June."
30,app,Fake organisation and never buy product from this app and I stop buying product from Tata group
30,app,"I had to constantly request for feedback even then no response only being told that someone will get back to me, eventually I got tired of waiting and ask to cancel if they can't respond... the executive was very prompt on cancellation which surprised me... they were not prompt in solving but cancelling my loan application... boom instantly helped with that. So clearly not bothered about the problems of a customer... very sad service did not except from my favourite Tata brand."
30,app,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
30,app,"Just imorove your app. Very slow. Cannot use saved cards intata neu app, but in bigbasket it can be used. Funny. And for grocery sodexo not allowed, are you in business? Eheres on bigbasket you can use, only in app not allowed. You are actually telli g me to not use neu app and better do bigbasket. You guys are funny"
30,app,I am unable to update my last name on the app. I have raised more than 5 complaints and called multiple times. But nothing seems to work here. Pretty pathetic!
30,app,"There are lot of issues at the core product design in Neu App. I tried suggesting the customer care for an improvement in future and they say 'this is how it works'. Well, I know how crappy currently it is and that's why I sent a suggestion but typically 'thats not a customer support issue' attitude."
30,app,Very good service i love tata neu app and tata family â£ï¸â£ï¸
30,app,Lone ta approved holo na kano sir
30,app,OTP LOGIN ISSUE is NOT RESOLVED on 9693280790 mobile tata neu app
30,app,"It's nearly 10 days since my loan is approved ,but not disbursed,, offline visit of your rep is also done. Very pathetic approach, your executives as if they call to check whether I am dead or alive that's all. Very disappointed"
30,app,"My hotel bills are still to be credited. The representetives are not aware of the benifit details. Also my hotel booking are still not appearing in my order section automatically, i still nee to enter the booking referance. i am expecting my forth comng booking details to appear in my app on my mobile. This is happening in all other apps and i feel this request is very simple request, which i believe can be impemented immedistely without any delay."
30,app,If you keep on calling and ask again when a customer applied how are going to help with something. None of the customer reps had a clue what the progress was and kept on saying theyâ€™ll check with superior. Next day again a new rep calls who doesnâ€™t have a clue either
30,app,"Site is very slow. No offers are available. Unable to make UPI payment. I wonder, why did I chose tata neu? Not at all happy with the experience."
30,app,Only I feel the EMI card purchase all other apps so be good that it otherwise always good
30,app,The app needs to be improved and made more customer friendly and the representative does not reply anything other than saying sorry for the inconvenience caused.
30,app,"Very..nice,,customer,care.service..i.really..proud.of..tataneo.app..thankyou"
30,app,I unable to find my ordered product so how to happy with Tata neu
30,app,My redmi phone does not allow me to open play Store to give feedback or even install the app. Suggest you provide customers a link for downloading the app. Redmi phone has their own getme one can use it to install. I don't use the getme app Unless I have no other option. Your team can work out a solution to this issue.
30,app,Poor app features. Very poor customer service. The person did not know anything about the process... had to ask each answer from his supervisor. In the end he was not at all useful. Getting access to the customer care was a major task
30,app,Different person's name is listed or picked in my account/profile....!!! It's a clear data confidentiality breach.. app is in secure..!!
30,app,"30 April & 5 May I purchased from Croma Calicut around 90000rs ; Store team told me Tata neu coins will added within 15 days ; very disappointed to say nothing will credited from any where, itâ€™s very cheating from the Tata side, Calicut manager and sales team not support, No one knows offers or coins details, I have lots of Corparate orders, I want to purchase from Croma or any Tata concerns,but these types of ambiance and attitude No need future buy from Croma; Sales staff as billing staff ;need improve the knowledge of offers and neu coins , TATA is a major leading company in our country So sadly said that Customer satisfaction nothing. Sadly say that I will never purchase from Tata Croma anymore."
30,app,Baddest app waste
30,app,"Over all good. But big basket and croma has not delivered goods in Amreli, Gujarat. This is not good. Some changes required in app for smooth functioning."
30,app,"Without even reading and understanding the complaint, the customer care executive copy pasted a templates response to check my internet and update the app. I was complaining that the addresses are greyed out and I was unable to select one. Which is a typical bug."
30,app,"IHCL points transfer is the worst, I have been told it takes 7 days to get the points reflect in Tata neu account. But itâ€™s not what happens"
30,app,Totally wrost app
30,app,"Not going to recommend, i am also going to uninstall the app if my issue is not going to resolve within next 48 hours, it is almost 5 days i am waiting fir escalation team to resolve the same and waiting fir their callback, not yet receive any single follow up call. Pathetic"
30,app,What can your representative do when your app is unable to let me register for UPI
30,app,"I would like to inform you that I was assured that I would receive 5% nue points on my purchasing through Tata neu app. I called in month of April 2022 on customer care no of Tata Neu App (before my purchase) and was Informed regarding the same i.e. 5% neu points. But till date I have received the 5% neu points of my purchasing. Moreover, I had a talk on 13th May 2022 with Mr. Mehul and Ms. Bhawan( Supervisiors), they also assured me that I will get the points in my account ( mobile no 880067866) but till date I havenâ€™t received the 5% nue points . Kindly do the needful ."
30,app,"I purchased a mobile phone from Tata neu app. Instead of getting 5 neu coins per 100, I got less. I also emailed a video (which I had to make as this thing has he opened earlier to me also) to the customer care team. It clearly shows I have purchased from Tata neu, still the customer care is disagreeing an saying that I have purchased from Croma website. If you see my history of purchases, I have been buying a lot of items from Tata neu. I am not happy with the current status of my problem. Tata neu has less varieties and higher costs in some items, still supporting the app as itâ€™s made in India. But if the customer care wonâ€™t support properly, I am not likely to suggest this to my friends. Thanks."
30,app,Ticket was closed without any resolution even after I have shared all yhe screnshots. Highly disappointed and frustrated.
30,app,1.Difficult and slow response for chat support window. 2.No email received for orders places and had to open app every time to check list of items. 3.There should be option of calling customer back to discuss any concerns. 4.Product quality not upto the mark despite of premium prices. 5.One Tshirt was placed as Large size but delivered as Medium. 6.One shirt which was delivered was not having one button. 7.I am requesting to deliver on 22nd May but no update yet. 8.Need to work and update app for seamless usage and customer friendly. Good luck ?
30,app,Bahut ghatiya app hai
30,app,Customer service is good but disappointed with tata nue.
30,app,App is a terrible expirience. On bigbasket it said 10% neucoins and it said nowhere only when you purchase on the (desasterous) app.what a FRAUD
30,app,When I want to add address your app take me to Google map which doesn't show my correct address and i am not able to write anything . So this much confidence that Google always right doesn't justify. You must provide both ways i. e. Writing adress manually and Google's
30,app,It is very disappointing that nobody spoke to me today & you are asking feedback?
30,app,Slow app interface.... But good services
30,app,"Poor customer service bad experience , u need a lot of improvement in finance part of the app"
30,app,I paid for two orders and nothing is reflected in the tata Neo app. Payment has been deducted but no items delivered or status updated yet.
30,app,"My Qmin order from the Hotel Mint, Bangalore was not delivered and the refund is not processed even after the deadline of 7 working days. None from the customer service knows what is the exact status of my refund and who from TataNeu app or Qmin or Mint has to approve my refund"
30,app,"My Qmin order from the Hotel Mint, Bangalore on May 14th was not delivered and the refund is not processed even after the deadline of 7 working days. None from the customer service knows what is the exact status of my refund and who from the TataNeu app or Qmin or Mint has to approve my refund. I fail to understand why the multiple related tickets raised were closed in a hurry on reaching the time deadline, though there is no resolution to the main issue and is pending beyond any official or reasonable timeline"
30,app,The app lags too much. Many people have given this app worst ratings still the app developers doing nothing... Croma only have few electronic product comparing to other shopping brands. It's like you don't care about customer experience and just care about 5% neu coins.
30,app,The app is not at all user friendly or I say not even connecting with Android OS . Not Satisfied
30,app,today is the 3rd day yet no resolution has been found the transaction error that happened..
30,app,My first bill has been stucked on neu app since 3 days
30,app,I'am not happy with customers service....so kindly resolve my issue.
30,app,Happy ?
30,app,very bad things happened with me. I selected Oberai Mall (Goregaon) for Pickup and you have given me 20 km away location of Sion
30,app,Application is too worst from Saturday onwards i am following up with your team but not issue has been resolved and also app is closing automatically what is this
30,app,But app speed and Navigation simplicity is need to look up on
30,app,The human interaction part was excellent. The system part was not upto the mark. From the Qmin app I had placed order for delivery to my home in Kolkata with 700075 pincode. The order acknowledgement which came by email mentioned my pincode as 600001 which is in Chennai. The concern was resolved over phone but such computer errors need to corrected.
30,app,Tata neu app is worst of its kind with typical rules. Really pathetic.
30,app,not happy with the use of app and cc
30,app,We are looking for improvement and customer service in your app. As of now its very slow and no quick customer care
30,app,My order has been placed but I am not able to view my order in the app. Neither has it been delivered .
30,app,"i didnot receive any response and even in app, I dont see any response to the ticket. Infact no ticket is displayed in app"
30,app,Bilkul bakvas app hai gift card ka lalach dekar app downlod karva liya or ab kuch order nhi ho raha
30,app,Bilkul bakvas app hai gift card ka lalach dekar app downlod karva liya or ab kuch order nhi ho raha
30,app,Tata Neu is a terrible app. And the customer service is pathetic!
30,app,Bilkul bakvas app hai gift card ka lalach dekar app downlod karva liya or ab kuch order nhi ho raha
30,app,Happy ?
30,app,I was trying to book taj Tirupati and I am not getting 25 percent off as it was mentioned on app. Tata neu helpline gave me ihcl helpline number and they again gave me Tata neu helpline number creating a visous circle of no help
30,app,Improve on the product I didn't get any coins after my BB grocery delivery. Also there are frequent closing of app and collapse
30,app,"Disagree, I have booked philips 3000 series dryer 3days before still order is not yet confirmed, really disappointed.."
30,app,Very slow response the app
30,app,"Takes too much of time. Don't value customer's time and money!! Disappointed with the Ticket service, they cannot understand 72 hours is really a long time to wait for a ticket to get resolved."
30,app,"Stop wasting time in this survey and concentrate in fixing the issues like stabilising app, make it in sinc with stores improve time to respond and close and most important meet the time line. Not expected such a bad scenario from group like Tata."
30,app,worst app I came across
30,app,"Dear Irfan / Priyanka / Amalorpava, I am really fed up with your such generic response every time/day. Since last one week I am hearing from your team that your team is working on my case and they will get back to me within 72 hrs. !!!! Can you please specifically mention why I am not getting my refund yet when refund time is already due and TAT is already expired !!! How long you want to hold customer's money ??? I am not at all happy on your pathetic service and want my money refund immediately. Please arrange to refund my money by today EOD and close my EMI account positively without any further excuses and avoid further mentally harrassment to your customer."
30,app,"Being a TATA employee twice in my lifetime upto now ,i am very much happy with their services...EX -TCS EMPLOYEE AND NOW TPCODL EMPLOYEE."
30,app,Worst app i ever see. My issue not resolved till now
30,app,"Very bad app , I have 100 Rupees amount in TATA neu coins But right now it's showing 0 Can I know the reason why there is no amount"
30,app,A simple process of refund is not processed since 6th May and I am following on this regularly... Shouldn't have gone through tata neu application first and last mistake
30,app,"I am really fed up with your such generic response every time / day. Since last one(1) week I am hearing from your team, that your team is working hard on my case and they will get back to me within 72 hrs. !!!! Don't know from where your 72hrs. will be completed !!! Can you specifically mention why I am not getting my deserve refund yet ?? when refund time TAT is already expired / due !!! How much more time do you want consume from me ?? Why you are holding customer's money like this way ??? I am not at all happy on your pathetic service and such pathetic customer support is beyond of my imagination from TATA like an organisation!!! I have already given enough time to you , now I want my money refund immediately. Please arrange to refund my money by today and also close my EMI account by today positively without any further excuses and avoid further mentally harrassment to your customer."
30,app,Zero rating should be also there...you guys have failed expectations miserably..I am deleting app for sure..
30,app,"I Trust Ratan Tata, but I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong My First Oder Experience with Neu app first they Delayed my order and later canceled it itself. Worst Shopping Experience I have ever face."
30,app,Very bad service and app. I order thrice procudts from tataneu electronics but all three order cancelled and amount debited from my account. After entering payment otp its showing service unavailable. This is unavailable and i am still waiting for the payment. I will never ever use this app again. First of all you will not get your order and secondly you will end up paying for the thing which you will not get and then wait for reimbursement.
30,app,You guys are still havenâ€™t teething issues with fluency of app. Hope to see that everything will be good in coming days. All the best. I am happy to see Tata Neu finally here.
30,app,Itâ€™s been 5 days since I ordered a headphone. But there is no status report from help desk. I am so disappointed. Bad very bad experience.
30,app,Very good reply and helping app
30,app,"I am unable to track an order that I placed on your website, which is highly disappointing. To top it of, the customer care executives were replying like bots with scripted responses which is pathetic. Now I don't where my order is or if/when I will receive it!"
30,app,Worst experience had in my life. Will never recommend to any of my friend to use this app
30,app,"Tata Neu / BB have been sending messages on Neu Coins/ Neu membership etc. Incessantly. I have disabled all notifications on the app at my end, yet they continue. Please differentiate between service messages, like delivery status and promotional messages. Its very bugging to be spammed by such a respected brand"
30,app,"It is a great initiative. Just need to fix some bugs and app speed issue. At support end, need to train for better response rather than just saying uninstall and install the app. Rest, I am very proud of Tata Neu App - Desh ka App,"
30,app,"Please confirm my order status or kindly refund back transaction ASAP , itâ€™s been 3 days awaited and no visibility still, appreciate your earliest support !!"
30,app,Only able to read whatever information is available on app. Anyone can refer the app. What is the point of customer support then. No idea about query and no resolution provided.
30,app,Only able to read whatever information is available on app. Anyone can refer the app. What is the point of customer support then. No idea about query and no resolution provided.
30,app,My ticket is taking too much of time to resolve the issue. It's quite disappointing.
30,app,I had asked which store I can buy iPhone 13 128gb midnight black colour. I also asked whether the price would be approx 69000 with HDFC cashback as per recent advertisements. She was clueless. Maybe your system is not in sync with advertisements.
30,app,Not trust worthy application and people.
30,app,I'm understanding the neu app it's just new to me will update the review in coming days hope Fully. Just can't able to understand I haven't purchased anything my 10 neu coin has been debited ?. I'm unsatisfied with your partner CROMA
30,app,"Your app does not work and your IT team is of no use If there is no timely solution, the issue is not solved and customer suffer One cannot wait for a solution to come after your research when planning to buy some material"
30,app,Finally I am not receive any details my personal loan approval why rejected your verification person not coming my house and it's apdet please give me answeraddress not pound I give all details my documents kyc apdet my bank account details civil score is good why my loan rejected
30,app,A lot of features and offers are unclear. Order processing is taking a lot of time. Grocery section app hangs. Overall experience is poor.
30,app,I asked for Neu cash on 14th May against the purchase I made at Croma and till the date it has not been credited to my account. I deleted the app after this experience with you
30,app,Worst customer Care not solved problem and issue I'm not happy not response all
30,app,You app is very very slow then how we can use you are app
30,app,No very very time west app no recomended any other
30,app,My 959 nue coins were automatically deleted and now in app it is showing 0. I contacted customer care but they are saying you have 959 coins but in my app it is showing 0. Very bad app
30,app,"Still waiting for your pickup guy, for my return and refund, from 11 may 2022, very disappointed from your services. Already lodged atleast 4 to 5 time complaint and talk to your executives."
30,app,the most worst app and customer care in my life
30,app,"Paper less ? Quick approval ? No documents needed? My one week wasted ... I was like looking forward to get my quick loan...after your attractive tags lines ,it was like trust on tata capital ,, after so much of calls , documentation and home visit they cant even approve the application ? thanks but ur tags are good but you have to implement on them to build trust on your upcoming costumers"
30,app,The app is not properly developed. You cannot distinguish which app the order was placed from. I placed from TataNeu but your system says BB. Your executive implied im lying or im delusional. You people need to accept there can be a technical errors on your new app. I am not kind of person to make stories for 50 neu coins. I have uninstalled the app and I won't recommend it anyone only because you people fail to accept your mistakes and imply that the customer is a liar. Its not about the coins but because you your Ccare people don't listen and accept that there can be a problem.
30,app,There is lot of problems in the app while payment
30,app,"My order was to be delivered on 24 may but delivered on 26 may and that to only 13 items delivered instead of total 27 items ordered, Moreover tatanue app. is not working properly,there are operating problems in the app.very bad experience so far dealing with tatanue app. No camparision with Amazon."
30,app,It takes too much time to resolve the tickets. That's quite disappointing.
30,app,Excellent service by the Tata's new app. Wish them all the success as is common with every Tata company!!
30,app,Tata Neu Customer Service Sucks. The agentâ€™s don't have the information about the offers and about the app.
30,app,"Worst app giving fake availability of products, fake shipping detail's, after 14 days of waiting period they said my product is out of stock so my order got cancelled such a waste of time to create this useless app"
30,app,Its been 6 days now since i didnt receive tata coins for taking a airasia flight. When you are booking a flight it does not allow you to use tata coins for some reasons all the time. So basically TATA neu is not a good app or idea. I dont wanna recommend it but even though my recommendation would not matter here in this world coz nowadays ppl are dump and blind. They cant relate things. Cheap service and cheap idea first time in T@T@. Bye bye. Dont need your coins. Keep for yourself.
30,app,"It's just waste of time for customer ,I try to do the order of AC for more than 20 times but it not happening due to technical issue regarding the application Tata neu app"
30,app,Very casual and sub-standard customer care. Ticket closed without resolution. Croma purchase of 7 May yet to reflect on app and points credited. No resolution provided by your team.
30,app,"Had placed an order on Taj Yeshwantpur through the Qmin app for delivery between 12:00 and 12:30. It seems the hotel never received the order. I called customer support at 12:45 or so, and she redirected me to the hotel. Finally, they were able to deliver at around 2:50 pm."
30,app,This was my first purchase from Tata Neu as I was looking for an alternative to Amazon/ Flipkart. But I am very disappointed with the service. I never had such experience while doing any shopping on Amazon/ Flipkart in last 10-12 years. Now i will have no choice but to go back to Amazon/ Flipkart only. Thanks for the great experience.
30,app,"Customer service, the app everything needs a lot of improvement. There is Tata trust, please donâ€™t let it overshadowed by poor app experience and customer service"
30,app,Tata Neu app is dead slow
30,app,Various problems with the app. This app should be discontinued
30,app,Itâ€™s been 24 days since you canâ€™t credit points for a qualified stay at taj Pierre. Every time you say itâ€™s been resolved. Your customer cell makes ppl wait online for 30 mins and then goes silent. Very bad app
30,app,Want to return the ironbox that I bought. Submit button is not working though all fields are filled in. Close is working fine. Tarried to reach customer number provided in app and its being answered by an Ayurvedic hospital. Tried chat support and they are not knowledgeable and never return or respond. Being a Tata employee I want to try and buy products through Neu but disappointing with the app and customer service. Want some one to call me and have my return issue fixed. Order number - TC300024868635
30,app,Good service by Tata neu customer care staff I am very happy
30,app,"My loan was approved , didn't complete kyc, and verified Very bad service"
30,app,I didn't get the details I contacted for I m really very much disappointed with customer care service.
30,app,"Very bad service. I had applied for a Personal Loan on 21st. April. All my paperwork are done. Even the e-mandate procedure was done and Tata Neu took 118/- from my Account, but it's been about 40 days gone. Still the LOAN amount of 1 Lakh is not disbursed ."
31,neu coins,No one understand my problem/query. No one took efforts to resolve it. First the employee in Croma Chandigarh have no knowledge. They are not conform me about how i get neu coins. All employees are full  lack of knowledge/ schemes
31,neu coins,Allow us to use neu coins if we order directly from bigbasket and pay through tata neu ðŸ˜
31,neu coins,Option of COD and use or payment of neu coins should be linked.  Present no options available to use neu coins with COD for orders
31,neu coins,You are provide many account neu coins and in my account you are not provide any coins 
31,neu coins,The query is not resolved. Generally post delivery from bigbasket in 5 minutes i receive the tata neu coins and transaction gets posted. Even after 72 hours still I have not received my 5% neu coins and no resolution still the query is showing resolved. 
31,neu coins,It's not clear from app or customer care that which transaction got neu coins and how to redeem. Query resolution chat has categorised hence we can't explain exact issue 
31,neu coins,My 250neu coins is still not received 
31,neu coins,"My query was regardind refund in forms of neu coins for a cancelled order on tata cliq. Here tata cliq is the product of TATA. Neu coins are the product of TATA. Here in my case no third party or bank was involved , only tata's products were involved. Still it took 10 days to resolve the query. Qorst service by TATA. Thus is my second experience regarding TATA products where first and second level cystomer services are very poor. Previously a year ago i had to contact up to the level of the CEO of tata aia insurance for solution of my query related to my health policy."

31,neu coins,"I placed my order from CROMA only because the product was not showing on the TATA NEU APP, but the points credited to me were 0.33% instead of 5% (as claimed by TATA NEU) even though croma being a TATA company. No where was it mentioned that the purchase has to be made with tata neu app, and nowhere it was mentioned that croma will give only 0.33% neu coins. Its disappointing and unacceptable. "
31,neu coins,"Tata neu app payment process is not proper ,this has happened two times earlier,
Particularly when we use payment by adjusting neu coins it is getting stuck and payment fails.pl look into this i could not get solution to this , ultimately i had to pay by agreeing to  cash on delivery without adjusting neu coins."
31,neu coins,"After 6 days, wrong reason given for not giving cashback as neu coins"
31,neu coins,"Apurva was amazing, she helped me with the query with the right resolutions. She also guided me about the tata neu coins and whats the use of it. She is a star âœ¨"

31,neu coins,"There has been lot gap /confusion in terms of how to earn neu coins. Plus the NeuApp also is not great performance wise if you try to navigate to any partner app like BB, Tatacliq, etc from neu app itself, thereby impacting the overall experience badly. Happy to share/connect more inputs if reached out to."
31,neu coins,I asked about my whereabouts of 5 percent of neu coins of delivered order of BB . But I didnt get any response.
31,neu coins,Didn't receive 200 neu coins even after following the procedure
31,neu coins,"Very late response there should be toll free number and voice assistant for better clarification of offers , theres no tata neu coins on purchase from offline store"
31,neu coins,But still neu coins not credited
31,neu coins,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
31,neu coins,"It will take lot of time for customers executives respons so,I have disconnected the chat. My query is stills pending. My question when did I received my neu coins back for I have returned Item itâ€™s been 4 Days. Can you please help me on this"
31,neu coins,I was told that o would get remaining neu coins but didnt get any
31,neu coins,This is bad you should give 5% neu coins when u buy in other tata apps and not restricted to tata neu app
31,neu coins,Not resved my issue tata neu coins not resved 7 billing issue 5% tata neu coins
31,neu coins,1st of all the app needs huge performance improvements. It is very slow. 2nd I had 500 neu coins when I tried to use it that time it did not happen and finally when I had thr option to use it then you guys are saying it had expired.
31,neu coins,"I didn't get my neu coins, I refered to my friend"
31,neu coins,Add neu coins on UPI payments also and also give some reward when I refer to my friends.other wise app is good.
31,neu coins,No extra neu coins 5% extra on tata cliq
31,neu coins,I have been following up for last 7 days for tataneu coins to be credited for my stay at Taj bengal on 18-20 March 2022 and so far it has not been resolved from your end
31,neu coins,No resolution provided. I was not told how to make use of neu coins properly and also my deducted money wasn't returned to bank account.
31,neu coins,"The issue is not resolved and every time we make a transaction which is eligible for neu coins, we need to email and follow up. None in customer care is aware"
31,neu coins,I havenâ€™t received neu coins for my last purchases worth 70000. Order id SOA092000472591
31,neu coins,"Still my tata1mg points is not converted in tataneu coins,"
31,neu coins,He not give me proper answer I m asking about my neu coins my purchase date is before launch date that time we gate 5% neu coins from both place store & application but he told me other options
31,neu coins,After many communication my neu coins not received
31,neu coins,There should be a proper sheet or way from where we can also know about the complete information regarding migrated 1mgcash amount and we should have the right to track neu coins.
31,neu coins,My 1mg cash 770 and 90 has not been migrated to neu coins . And then Your complain referance number is 702002 has not resolved till now
31,neu coins,Query was not clarified and misinformation about neu coins that you get minimum assured coins on transactions via tata neu app or web. The customer service agent was not aware of the fact written in faq that neu coins are assured on all transactions via tata neu app
31,neu coins,Where are neu coins and the cliqcash ?
31,neu coins,I am using 1 mg from past 2 years. Never faced this issue and recommended this to many. But this time the service is unsatisfactory. My 1mg coins were deducted automatically and not converted into neu coins. I am mailing since so many days and talked to customer care as well but query not resolved.
31,neu coins,My 1mg cash was migrated for neu coins but never reached it. Also it's impossible to reach 1mg support. What is the idea of ordering online for medicine when 3 of them were cancelled and not provided any alternative and ultimately we need to go to market to hunt for those medicines.
31,neu coins,"Iam very upset with Tata Neu, i used to earn good number of coins while using BB app. Now it has suddenly stopped stating i need to buy through Tata Neu? was there any communication???????????????? i have placed 2 orders 1632/- and 1225/- where i was supposed to earn 10% extra neu coins. I received a message that 10% additional coins would be added to my account. Now i have received a message that it was wrongly stated i will not be getting the coins !!!!!!! is this a joke?"
31,neu coins,"Tata brand doesnâ€™t need to get into coercive methods to ensure stickiness for its brand, so itâ€™s disappointing that you are resorting to it! Eg ok 1MG why would you force users to pay through your wallet only instead of usual gpay to be able to avail neu coins redemption. Also if I want to exit as a customer out or Tata neu you donâ€™t even have a process that ensures my data is deleted at your end nor does your team know anything about it"
31,neu coins,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
31,neu coins,still no solution of neu coins. not credited even after 9 days.
31,neu coins,Your offer says 10% neu coins on order above 1200 but not yet received
31,neu coins,I had a query on the offer on Big basket for which I received an email which said that you get 10% tata neu coins when you shop at Bigbasket using the Tata neu app. However I received only 5%. On reaching the customer care she was not clear on the offer. She mentioned that I would not get any coins as I paid using existing neu coins which I feel is incorrect.
31,neu coins,"I had made full payment through net banking mode for an order from big basket. I received a torn packet of Ashirwad atta, so requested for a replacement. Got my replacement on the same day but my neu coins were deducted. Through the chat menu got to know that neu coins were used to make payment."
31,neu coins,I send to Money transfet to other contact number but not no credit neu coins
31,neu coins,The customer is not good they donâ€™t reply on time my problem is not yet solved regarding tata neu coins. Whats the point of joining if the very thing I downloaded it for is not getting it on time.
31,neu coins,Issues with neu coins crediting system. Especially with the purchase done on CROMA
31,neu coins,"I didn't receive the neu coins for the flight tickets that I booked through the TATA Neu app, The Flight was initially booked by TATA Neu, however, the flight got Rescheduled by Air Asia, As per the customer care , it is Air Asia's fault that i couldn't get Neu Coins This is not a behavior that is Expected from a TATA Group Company, If it is the Response of the Group employees then what would be with others. You are requested to Resolve these issues and take this instance as learning."

31,neu coins,I have purchased 6 products and lowest profit value is 38k+ and same has been captured in your system. Also all the product values are mentioned by your team in tickets. However neu coins are not credited in my account yet. Customer service provide same answer as team is working. I really don't understand what kind of investigation they are doing and what Information you need. If you don't provide service and offer to your customer on time please don't promise.... I will stop using tata neu if I don't get response in next 48hrs.
31,neu coins,I have booked the flights. Because of name mismatch i am not eligible for neu coins. What's wrong in it if i use kumar in my name or not. That's my full name. I strongly disagree with the solution. This is my first and last booking with tata neu app. I am not going to use it anymore. Even i am Going to delete it now.
31,neu coins,"This app used to lagg very much and secondly, i have 130 neu coins in my neupass but day after that when i see my neu coins it shows error and zero balance in neu pass and iam unable to use neu coin in Tata 1Mg."

31,neu coins,App need update regarding neu coins statement and neu coins balance
31,neu coins,"People have said that their past orders were considered for neu coins, however I was told only for future orders. Not sure whom to believe"
31,neu coins,"TATA NEU don't have many basic features like UPI payment option while ordering anything. Terms & conditions are not clearly mentioned fir neu coins. It's biggest confusing thing. App is so laggy. It takes some times more than 5-10 secs to open new page which irritates customer if we have many other smooth other alternative apps available. We are here only for the name of TATA. Don't ruin the name of TATA by making such bad product. It seems app was launched without any preparations & there is no common sense. How can you miss UPI payment option for orders, seriously?"
31,neu coins,My ticket 671039 is still not resolved as I have got only 1207 neu coins as against 2277 neu coins whic was entitled for a spend of Rs 9108 at Taj Bengal. Have submitted all invoices as the offer clearly states 25% neucoins. Pls credit the balance 1070 coins in my account at the earliest and confirm
31,neu coins,I will use it lifetime with free shipping and neu coins system. Awesome ?
31,neu coins,Neu coins for latest order dated 22/04/2022 not credited though orders of nov 2021 to march 2022 earned neu coins. Logic not understood from TATA e- commerce group
31,neu coins,Customer service was not upto mark.. plz tell how to use neu coins..
31,neu coins,Representative could not understand what my problem was in the first place And my problem is still not resolved The problem was that I did not recieve 10% tata neu coins for my big basket orders. I have placed 2 big basket orders above 1200 so far. I recieved only 5% coins on one order and zero on the second order
31,neu coins,"Issue is still not resolved, not receiving neu coins for my purchases"
31,neu coins,Bought through Tata Neu at bigbasket on promo stated that 10% neu coins would be awarded if purchase over 1200. Coins did not get credited for 72 hours post which grievance raised - neu got back stating 5% crecited in neu account and balance 5% if not credited one should get in touch with bigbasket??? How does bigbasket have ability to credit neu coins for a tata neu customer??? Why should tata neu holder chase bugbasket for 5% credit???
31,neu coins,Where is my neu coins . I purchased through tata neu app rs 2k but I didn't receive neu coin
31,neu coins,"It is disappointing to see Tata not walking the talk when it comes to credit of Neu coins. I had spent ~42k exclusive of taxes on a booking in IHCL. As per the advertisement, I should have received 5% of the credit in terms of Neu coins. I only got 1368 neu coins against 2100 going by simple math."
31,neu coins,Make available use of neu coins for bill payment also.
31,neu coins,Processes are not properly laid down and systems not tuned as per laid down process. Did 2 transactions and didn't get neu coins automatically. I had raise complaints which took more than 3 days to resolve that too after reminders. One is yet to be resolved.
31,neu coins,"It has been more than 10 days, not getting neu coins for 6 of my transactions even after complaining several times to customer care. Ticket id #912490"
31,neu coins,I raised an issue that I have not received neu coins (180) for my order delivered on 30th April through bigbasket. I have not received any resolution on the same.
31,neu coins,my neu coins not refunded
31,neu coins,"Even writing for 5 times, 10% neu coins on order on bisbsket through tata neu app, neu coins not credited. Last order, even 5% coins not given ."
31,neu coins,Issue was that neu coins not awarded for Air Asia as middle name was not updated in Tata Neu profile. I find this very rigid and inflexible. And ways to find excuse to not give neu coins.
31,neu coins,my neu coins is still not credited
31,neu coins,"I guys never credit the eligible neu coins on time, it's like we hv to beg u to do so. Disgusting service"
31,neu coins,"Details are hidden in Terms and condition, locking periods are no where mentioned, no transparency! all of sudden refund is initiated for an order. migration of 1mg cash to neu coins are not done properly ( simple 5th standard do better calculation )"
31,neu coins,"I got 2 neu coins instaed of 5% as you advertise, which is a mockery of the customer. for bill amount of 750 @5% i should have got 37 points. bad experience"
31,neu coins,"Me being the TCS employee, I feel really disappointed for using tata Neu and also feeling bad for recommending it to my friends. I reached out to tata neu chat support and twitter support as I didnt get the neu coins for the product I purchased from croma store on May 6th (Invoice:SLA095001514772). Almost 10 days. no point in reaching out to customer care. I dare how they send for customer service feedback without resolving the issue."
31,neu coins,Not at all satisfied for the resolution...I need to get 10% neu coins. But got only 5%...
31,neu coins,"I did not receive 5% neu coins after ordering grocery worth 850 from tata neu app. Customer care told â€˜Sir there is nothing we can do about this, our system is showing you did not order from tata neuâ€™ This is the resolution I received Good luck to tata neu team."
31,neu coins,Tata neu coins earned by me through Big Basket transactions are not reflected in my account.
31,neu coins,I have still not received neu coins for my order that id is SOA250001533892
31,neu coins,I have still not received neu coins for my order that id is SOA250001533892
31,neu coins,Mujhe message Aya ki 75 neu coins have been credited to your account per wo coins credit nehi hua he Jab me customer care executive se pucha wo kuch thik nehi bata pa rehe hai
31,neu coins,You people are cheaters. I lost my 278 neu coins... You people not value your customers. I requested a lot many times to provide my coins but you people did not. I quit here. I am not going to use your app further. I will use pharmeasy for my orders.
31,neu coins,I lost my neu coins for failed transaction and representative is not able to understand and it takes hell lot of time to respond
31,neu coins,While beeing a tata employee when all my co workers got 75 neu coins i didn't receive the same also your tool free number doesnt work
31,neu coins,my problem not yet resolved regarding tata neu coins
31,neu coins,"I am unable to pay using Tata neu coins, when ever we place an order on tata neu using coins the order is being placed as cash on delivery. We have 998 coins when we place order it shows zero coins. WHY?"
31,neu coins,"So many terms and conditions for earning 5% neu coins. When asked for those, no response from the customer support."
31,neu coins,"30 April & 5 May I purchased from Croma Calicut around 90000rs ; Store team told me Tata neu coins will added within 15 days ; very disappointed to say nothing will credited from any where, itâ€™s very cheating from the Tata side, Calicut manager and sales team not support, No one knows offers or coins details, I have lots of Corparate orders, I want to purchase from Croma or any Tata concerns,but these types of ambiance and attitude No need future buy from Croma; Sales staff as billing staff ;need improve the knowledge of offers and neu coins , TATA is a major leading company in our country So sadly said that Customer satisfaction nothing. Sadly say that I will never purchase from Tata Croma anymore."
31,neu coins,I need my neu coins credited urgently Otherwise itâ€™s a Cheating. Dilshad-9633123457
31,neu coins,"It has been more than a month. My issue is still unresolved. The 3 ticket id have been generated for the same reason in the past 30+ days. I am yet to get my Neu coins for 5 purchases made on big basket. Now, recently i was asked to provide prrof of my purchase and that i didn't get neu coins, which i provided. Still, no resolution to the issue even after that."
31,neu coins,Waste service my 204 neu coins were not credited
31,neu coins,"I purchased a mobile phone from Tata neu app. Instead of getting 5 neu coins per 100, I got less. I also emailed a video (which I had to make as this thing has he opened earlier to me also) to the customer care team. It clearly shows I have purchased from Tata neu, still the customer care is disagreeing an saying that I have purchased from Croma website. If you see my history of purchases, I have been buying a lot of items from Tata neu. I am not happy with the current status of my problem. Tata neu has less varieties and higher costs in some items, still supporting the app as itâ€™s made in India. But if the customer care wonâ€™t support properly, I am not likely to suggest this to my friends. Thanks."
31,neu coins,The app lags too much. Many people have given this app worst ratings still the app developers doing nothing... Croma only have few electronic product comparing to other shopping brands. It's like you don't care about customer experience and just care about 5% neu coins.
31,neu coins,"Never will recommend Tata Neu. Will not make that mistake. Its been more than 3 weeks, i havent got my Tata neu coins so far. It has been a pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Made a big mistake booking Gateway Chikmaglur through Tata Neu. Didnt get the best price and also, was not aware the price didnt include food. It didnt even cover breakfast. Tata Neu booking hid this fact from me and didnt show the price with food included. Ended up paying a huge amount for 2 days stay. And to top it, didnt even get Tata Neu coins for it."
31,neu coins,"Very bad app , I have 100 Rupees amount in TATA neu coins But right now it's showing 0 Can I know the reason why there is no amount"
31,neu coins,"Very bad experience, I have 100 Rupees amount in TATA neu coins But right now it's showing 0 Can I know the reason why there is no amount"
31,neu coins,"one of your croma representative convince to initiate refund in place of replacement my product. i told him that my neu coins validity is already expired so i can just replace my item but he promised me to return my neucoins with fresh validity if i am ready to refund instead of replacement. than he initiate refund on 20May22 .Now, neither i got my neucoins with fresh validity nor my old product."
31,neu coins,still the neu coins are not reflecting in my account .
31,neu coins,The app is not properly developed. You cannot distinguish which app the order was placed from. I placed from TataNeu but your system says BB. Your executive implied im lying or im delusional. You people need to accept there can be a technical errors on your new app. I am not kind of person to make stories for 50 neu coins. I have uninstalled the app and I won't recommend it anyone only because you people fail to accept your mistakes and imply that the customer is a liar. Its not about the coins but because you your Ccare people don't listen and accept that there can be a problem.
32,Customer service agent,Customer service agent is very co-operative and very intelligent about the knowledge.
33,loyalty points,The query is still unsolved and I lost opportunity to redeem 1010 loyalty points due to this.
33,loyalty points,"Some of the features planned are good specially consolidated bill payment, rewarding / loyalty points etc. Too early to recommend, there seems to be lot of teething issues and application performance needs to be improve ( ordering happened after 3 attempts)"
34,refund,"Its been 20 days and i havent been provided with neither my product nor my refund. It's the worst service i have ever experienced 
I would recommend noone to use your app or your service "
34,refund,Order delivery to late therefore I canceled order and still refund not received 
34,refund,Many time email and customer care call than long time after may payment is refund 40 day around time so not happy this service 
34,refund,We are facing cancellation or refund problem 
34,refund,"Yes. I placed order on 12-7-2022.
The order not executed n refund not made till date even after assured your 8 customer care executives promissed."
34,refund,"Very late refund , received after 10 working days"
34,refund,Sorry Tataneu very bad experience because order cancelled that's ok but refund process was delayed and slowly working on Tataneu app need to refund status checking  in the same Tataneu application  also thank you.
34,refund,Didn't get refund from 2 days. Wrost Application. 
34,refund,Worst customer support didn't receive my refund yet
34,refund,My refund quary is not resolved in 15 days
34,refund,I placed my order and after successful payment...it was not delivered to me . I got the information that the item is out of stock after 5 days of placing my order. And i have yet to to receive the refund.
34,refund,I placed a return request  nearly 10 days ago and till date no one has showed up for pick up and no refund.  I am constantly following up and it's a pain . Pathetic experienece will never recommend anyone 
34,refund,I told customer care 23 times and they said they resolve problem but still my refund not credit in my bank account.. 
34,refund,"Till today my issue is not resolved yet, wrost experience with this transaction. 
Please update the status of my transaction 
Either resolve my issue or refund me 
"
34,refund,Issue was never resolved. The advisor had no idea on refund timeline for the coupon. 
34,refund,"I have got refund which i paid through credit card, but i didn't get croma voucher refund."
34,refund,Till the date I have not received full refund 
34,refund,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
34,refund,"Your query process is very slow, you take so much time to reply the query of customer. I have lodged complain regarding my croma refund but still after 2 day there is no any response or any confirmation mail  from your side. Please improve your service like Amazon."
34,refund,"Customer Executive should reply the query not only the standard operative guidelines replies serve the purpose.
Like I was ask8ng for the transaction ID by which Refund is initiated , the standard replies were given ""we regret for the inconvenience it takes 5-7 days for credit of refund , please wait for 48 hes"" The waiting period was already 15 days over."
34,refund,"I really had terrible experience, as the pick up store was changed without informing, plus when I visited another store the stock did not last, while it showed ready to pick up in my app and above it no one cancelled the order as promised by Croma employee.

Above it my payment is not  processed though its 15th day, and that too, I had to make a complaint for refund; should it have been suo moto, I would be more happy as this created a negative impression in my mind about Neu that in future if there is issue with order, my funds are not safe, as refunds are not done on time neither Neu team cares about informing status to customer on itself, it is the customer who has to go and beg for his refund.

I would never prefer croma or neu for any shopping.
"
34,refund,"Mene order ke related Kai baar castomar se call Kiya tha but Mera order nahi diya gaya aur nahi refund Diya gaya
"
34,refund,They didn't initiate my refund
34,refund,I have not received my refund yet
34,refund,No work around if refund is not received ...just kept on saying apologies and refund will be sent in 5-7 working days.  
34,refund,"My query was regardind refund in forms of neu coins for a cancelled order on tata cliq. Here tata cliq is the product of TATA. Neu coins are the product of TATA. Here in my case no third party or bank was involved , only tata's products were involved. Still it took 10 days to resolve the query. Qorst service by TATA. Thus is my second experience regarding TATA products where first and second level cystomer services are very poor. Previously a year ago i had to contact up to the level of the CEO of tata aia insurance for solution of my query related to my health policy."
34,refund,Pathetic experience as almost 4 days has been taken even after multiple follow ups and escalation for initiate refund. Where I see other merchants like Flipkart and amazons are providing instant refund.
34,refund,"Pls provide email id, contact details for raising complaint in the customer profile section.
Refund should be in bank account and not in wallet.
There was no option available to see where my refund was credited. No intimation was provided regarding refund. "
34,refund,"1. if a customer pays by upi/bank/card why should the refund be made in BB wallet?
2. For an error made by the company, why should the customer's points be deducted? "
34,refund,1st time i used this app.. An my money got Stuck.. Still I don't got refund

34,refund,I was not informed that my coins was credited and its for short period. It expired without prior notice. I requested for refund but it did not happen. Very much unhappy and unsatisfied. 
34,refund,"Taken me 30 days to refund the neu coins because the order was cancelled by tataneu themselves
Worst coustemer service ever"
34,refund,20 days but still my refund not credit in my account
34,refund,"My query is still not resolved, my NeuCoins is not refunded yet. "

34,refund,"Worst customer service, refund pending for more than a month"
34,refund,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
34,refund,I chased for my refund for more than 2 months and I gave up. I am no more interested in pursuing for my refund. Very very disappointed with Tata Neu.
34,refund,"Order TC300032121947 placed on 24th aug and cancelled on same day, payment debited from credit card but its not credited again, raised complaint on email id of neu customer care, haven't received any tentative date of payment refund. Worst service "
34,refund,"You cancel the order only at the delivery due time.
Its DISGUSTING.
Because we expect product...
Compunding the problem is refund not done immediately 
Wish you look into it"
34,refund,Never seen a worst customer service in my life ... 2months now my money is not refunded .. no call communication from them... If I call them all they say is wait for another 73hrs... Like that it's 2month now ... I won't use this app nor suggest anyone to use this fraud app either
34,refund,TATA needs to be much quick in addressing transaction failure related refunds.
34,refund,"I think the refund should be resolved soon
It take nearly 20days "
34,refund,"It is yet to be resolved, no update on refund status "
34,refund,Give my refund quickly 
34,refund,"Nothing resolved, no refund initiated till date"
34,refund,"The worst shopping and customer care experience ever! Never shopping from Tata Neu again. Just to get an update on my order, it took more than 72 hours. Plus my order did not even get delivered. My refund has not been initiated. The customer care executive I spoke to first did not even understand the issue and says things like because a sale is ongoing on Westside products they couldn't handle my order. If an order cannot be handled by such a big brand it's better to shut it down for good. Never shopping from you and I am going to spread the word among my friends and family as well."
34,refund,"There was no resolution to my query. The customer executive stated it was a technical glitch due to which my order 122371107 was showing as ""payment timeout"" despite my credit card having been debited for the said amount. I was told I would get a refund, but I would have preferred my order to have been delivered instead. The app doesn't seem to be working to satisfactory level and should not be placed in the public domain until the glitches are sorted. Very disappointed!"
34,refund,Even after my bankdebited my account your app was showing payment as pending.That is why Icancelled the order.Still waiting for refund
34,refund,I still do not Received my refund
34,refund,"My quertis not resolved from past 20 days.
I did not get refund for order returned due to delay delivery. I have cancelled one item on 10 August amd for that i got refund on 25th August. Two Items I  have denied to recieve on 15 August sue to delay delivery still did not get any refund. How pathetic service tata neu has. One of the worst platform and poor service. You don't have any system and process for execution. Amazon, Flipkart and other platforms doesn't take more than 2-4 day's and here is tata neu which shamelessly replies on email that we are processing it. And that's processing is not even start from last 20 days. "
34,refund,A refund of Rs.1195 is awaited from Tataneu for cancelled Big basket order KMKCO-266598836-290882 for 7 items. The order was  cancelled on 30 August 2022. Please expedite the refund
34,refund,Even to take back a defective product it took several days by your team and I was only receiving emails after emails but no action. Now there is no noise about refund of my money. Tata Neu is a colossal failure I believe and would strongly advise my acquaintances to avoid using it for online purchase and prefer Amazon and Flipkart for their outstanding services. 
34,refund,"So much bad experience with tata neu
Still not received my refund amount 6770
Which should be refund in 7days but last 2&half month not received yet."
34,refund,"The customer was not central to the resolution but they were more focused on the process and took more than 10 days to resolve and made me lose taking medication stating it will be delivered and the money will not be refunded, finally to trace the refund it took them almost ten days, least expected out of TATAs after subscribing to their premium 1mg services "
34,refund,Order was cancelled on 21st of October and despite my repeated calls refund is not processed till a week. Pathetic customer care service
34,refund,Customer care me koi bat sunta hi nhi or jab mera order complete hua uske 2 din bad order cancel kar Diya kyuki price high krne k bad  or mere ko bolte he aapko refund milega AAP dusra order kr lo order karke mere ko 600 ki nuksani
34,refund,"I have had not so good experience with the fruits/vegetables quality / delivery from Big Basket. Sometimes not all the products ordered for are delivered, and sometimes the quality of fruits/vegetables is below the acceptable range. Although the returns / refunds have been done quickly by the customer service team, but the convenience of ordering online takes a beating because of quality of items and return/refund process (as it allows only one return / exchange per order). "
34,refund,If our refund is shifted to our big basket wallet then inform us 
34,refund,"My refund still not credited in my credit card

This should be clear on portal itself.
Pl refund my Rs4/-

34,refund,"Your customer support team is the worst. They have closed the ticket without completing my refund and resolving the issue. Atif, Damodaran, Vijay and team are lying and not fit for their job."

34,refund,My payment deducted for i phone 11 but order not placed on 16.6.22 . I complaint on same day but still i have no update n no refund . Name like tata is working like thief.
34,refund,"Please arrange to improve your refund system. Ideally the customers should be able to get their refunds, especially due to non-availability of some items and part or full cancellation by the seller, within 24-48 hours. Making the customers wait for days together due to no fault on their part is not fair."
34,refund,I had to cancel the order. Talked to customer care when I was directed to hotel staff. I could cancel. But refund not done yet. Again reached to customer care for call back but saw email came late night for further information and then received message that call closed and also email confirmation on successful delivery of order. I have not received the order. Need the refund ASAP.
34,refund,"My 5th order was cancelled even after order successful status. I cant believe why they have created this app if no one can order. Customer service is pathetic, they are not listening to customer and saying you will get refund and place again fresh order. This is unacceptable as i have already tried 5 times with different payment mode."

34,refund,I didnâ€™t get my refund yet but the mail which Tata neu croma send says the refund is credited to my account and poor response from costumer care executives
34,refund,I got harrassed for seven days without any proper explanation as to what caused the order to vanish from my account. The customer care executives kept on giving me 24 hours wait time to resolve my issue. Finally after 12 days I got my refund but I didn't get the refund of Croma voucher that I also used on the order.
34,refund,"My order got cancelled due to inprofessional delivery guy , & dont know exect status of my refund as well."

34,refund,Neither I got refund nor the issue was placed to relevant tech team.
34,refund,Order cancellation method and money refund process is worse.. even neu coins not refunded in my account since 15days past
34,refund,"The issue was not all resolved, till date. Requesting the Tata Neu Team to kindly resolve the issue and refund the cancellation amount of Rs.262 to Credit card and 37 Neu Coins."
34,refund,Infrastructure to process is pathetic. I have been waiting for 1 month to have my refund. Thereâ€™s no way to reach anyone in Tata 1 mg via phone but only by email or chatâ€¦ None of them have any experience in medicine or medical fields or e-commerce. Theyâ€™re are just dummies to apologise again and agin without giving any resolution to my problems. This feedback is mainly to Tata 1 mg customer care.
34,refund,"Very dissatisfied, sales exec Aalam did not know what he was doing, double ordered meds and my refund is not paid or logged in my account"
34,refund,The customer care executive could not guide me to something as basic as the BB wallet. I had a query regarding the refund of two undelivered products by Big Basket. The call dropped and the customer service desk did not bother enough to give me a call back to check regarding the unresolved query.
34,refund,My refund query is still pending
34,refund,Pathetic experience Order canceled automatically and still refund not received

34,refund,"my refund was not done for 1 month, after talking to customer care it was told will be done in 72 hrs, but it took 10 days to get refund after following up for 3 times."
34,refund,haven't received my refund yet
34,refund,No waiting for call .direct connected with customers care executive.and right information no eye wash.i received wrong product got returned.refund pending .hope I will get soon my refund
34,refund,"Kindly improve payment system, payment features, refund timing, includes train booking etc."
34,refund,"Worst experience of Tata Neo, they detected the payment, transaction shows failedâ€¦ they say 5 to 7 days for refund. Amazon does it in few minutes"
34,refund,I have done for the order and money was deducted and you stated payment was failed . Make a good payment gateway. I didn't refund till now. When will I get my money back i didn't order anything now. Disastrous
34,refund,Poor UPI service never use again refund time for 5 to 7 days.
34,refund,"the issue was , why electricity bill was not paid when the money already debit from my debit card.... well as per tata neu, i will get refund in next 5 days.... lets see... and what about the payments.... if for the payment i have to switch to amazon as it clearly shows that tata neu app is not able to paying the bill then why i need tata neu app?"
34,refund,"My issue with pending refund has not been resolved. The customer care is always eager to close the complaint tickets without providing resolution or making any progress on the issue. The whole experience of repeated reminders, requests and calls is harrowing to say the least. Extremely disappointed."
34,refund,Agent was very much aware of what customer expects but my query wasn't addressed due to internal mechanism. Had to wait for few more days for refund
34,refund,Payments doesn't work. It's failed twice and still no update on refund. How am I supposed to payback credit card bill it refund doesn't processed within time.
34,refund,Pls don't need this app ...i got payment debited but still I didn't get phone main thing I'm talking with customer care he said for 7 working days ..no phone money debited again need to wait for 7 days for refund why should all these headache just becoz of this app...pls don't make customer fools..becoz you don't know that how that money come from just simply 7 days it's easy but what about customer choice that phone is important for him can't even think for customer side .. simply technical issues all those stupid stuff.why should i need to msg all for this ..just becoz tata companies _/\_ pls don't spoil true legends names...will you help me out for this transaction
34,refund,Ur not responding properly I lost around 5777 rs by useing ur app i Don't know weather it will be refunded or not 5000 in UPI and 777 in bil payment to mescom
34,refund,"Never got a response from the customer representative. No message or intimation of what will happen to the transaction amount (will it be refunded, I hope it will, in how many hours/days/weeks, no message) I am completely in the dark about the status. Very disappointed."
34,refund,My issue didn't resolve yet. Didn't receive the refund for the technical issues of tata neu app. Worst app ever. No call received from the customer care executive
34,refund,"We have booked one order and we did not get that order delivered by big basket , where as order directly placed via big basket how ever that order did not deliver Later we cancelled reimbursement was not received just because I have recommended this app , I have paid all the refund to the one who booked in this worst and customer service has no idea what's going on"
34,refund,Simple request for return of Product is placed on the day of delivery still no one is looking into it?? For processing return request why so much time required?? Other App allowing Returns without Questions & very fast process of refund/replacement. I was expecting Tata will give competition to these foreign companies but my first experience is totally disappointing.
34,refund,Not recommended my friends .my fist payment was filled .and refund long time
34,refund,I am struggling for a transaction of DTH recharge which is stuck and showing status as pending from hours and each time your customer care executives are asking me to wait and telling me that either my connection will get recharged or will get refund within 5 to 7 days. Kindly explain me that how can I wait when my DTH subscription is about to expire in few hours.
34,refund,"The issue was not resolved by tata neu executive. I contacted him yesterday night but till now it was not resolved. Just now I contacted big basket and issue was resolved in 2 minutes. At first I chat with him on WhatsApp, he asked me to send the pics of the product in WhatsApp. I did so.He told he couldn't open it. Why so? He then shared and asked me to send a mail with pics. I did so? He replied and told that the issue will be resolved soon. But it didn't. 1. Issues should be addressed on time. 2. He was polite but the result was zero. 3. No customer will wait so long. 4. If you want to compete with Flipkart and Amazon the customer care should be quick and effective. Eg: The rate at which swiggy initiate refund is impressive. 5. I liked the use of WhatsApp. It's unique. But unfortunately he couldn't open the pics I sent. I don't know why? It kind of destroyed my mood to do business with you. 6. The customer care service should be seamless and he shouldn't be tired of waiting for your response. 7. You should keep a deadline to resolve to solve the issue, something like timeline to deliver the result. Like Zomato did while making delivery. 8. He understood the issue and was really supportive and polite. But as customer my issue was not solved. That's the reason I contacted him."
34,refund,I still donâ€™t know what is the exact status .. the communications are not clear. There is a huge grey area. Whether my order stands firm or cancel? If Iâ€™ll receive the refund .. etc .. I can be reached at 9819448088
34,refund,"My payment failed because of a technical issue in Neu App, it was debited from my bank account immediately. However, I have been told to place another order pay the same amount again and wait for 7 days to get a refund. How is this fair? Refund should be either immediate or within 24 hours. Why should I wait for 7 days to get my own money back?"
34,refund,Money got deducted but order did not get placed. Money should get refunded within same day instead its taking more than week.
34,refund,My bill was due on 22 April when the amount will when I have to pay that bill again please Tata send the refund on Monday asap
34,refund,I have been raising a refund issue for more than a month now without any resolution yet.
34,refund,"1st Transaction with your app and i landed in trouble and now will have to payment due charges also because of your app. Also, your team does not have clue where my money is pending and when it will be refunded Despite of sharing everything they have not done anything from past 48 hours"
34,refund,My money has not been refunded. Also adding an address correctly is a pain and still is not reflected correctly
34,refund,"My refund is stuck for 15days and counting, since I returned it. This way Tata Neu is not going far."
34,refund,I am still waiting for refund of the transaction failed.
34,refund,"It's more than 27 hours since i make the payment for the recharge and till now your team have no update for me. Why I am being the test subject for your experiments? Why I am paying the cost of your Technical issue or your incapability to provide service? If you can't do the service tell me straight forward and refund my amount, no hard feelings at least in that way I won't be suffering or wasting my time and energy"
34,refund,I have done a recharge which didn't process for 4 days and the customer care executive expects me to wait until it gets processed. Its very bad that a customer has to wait for more than 3 days to get a recharge done. It will be done in seconds in other platforms. Since the recharge was not successful even after 3 days of recharge I expected a refund which was denied by your customer executive.
34,refund,"9/04/22 order date, cancellation on ur own- 14/04/22, refund not received after5 days. Very bad management.Not expected from the concern TATA group."
34,refund,My order ID No TE-1008963743-20220416 has been cancelled on dated 17.04.2022 but not received refund till now
34,refund,Till now my refund was not credited
34,refund,Worst experience ever. My query is still unresolved and my 1mg cash is still not refunded.
34,refund,I did not even ask for refund but the refund process has started
34,refund,"Still, I neither got my refund nor any confirmation"
34,refund,very much disappointed with your service.. its been 3 days since I did a recharge.. still pending.. no refund
34,refund,Because i don't get any refund of my failed transaction
34,refund,"I had placed an order for a large appliance amounting to Rs. 16,191/- on 19.04.2022. For two days I did not get a confirmation on the status of the order and now I am being told that due to a technical glitch the order is being cancelled and my refund is being processed which would take another 4-5 working days to be credited to my bank account. What feedback do you expect me to give? Is my money and my time not worth it. I have lost offer on the order. How are you going to make up for all these things? Please be kind enough and let me know the answers to these questions also"
34,refund,"I'm dissatisfied with the service provided to me. Even after paying money online, I had to wait for 3 days just to get a response form query. I didn't waited for 3 days just to get a refund. How do I recommend this app to someone else when even employees of Tata group are facing these kind of issues."
34,refund,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
34,refund,Kindly initiate refund and first experience was worst
34,refund,"Worst service,worst app, i will delete this app, once my refund is back"
34,refund,"Still concern is not resolved. Got a mail from croma that i will get refund, but customer care on tata neu are not aware."
34,refund,"My refund is stuck for around 20 days, No confirmation regarding success of return and initiation of refund.. Worst possible service."
34,refund,Tata Neu took money. Then cancelled order citing 'Technical Issues' 2 days after. Money not yet refunded. Pathetic experience
34,refund,"Your staff is good for nothing -- since last 4 days they keep repeating same copy paste statements -- sorry -- wait for 72 hours -- wait for 72 hours -- every day same statement -- even after 4 days we chat and same statement -- wait for 72 hours...

34,refund,"The fact that Tata Neu only reached out to me after 4 chat message discussions with customer service reps and 1 call itself says a lot worse about Tata Neu CS. I also have an inkling to why this could be happening. When I first palced a replacement request no one listened..and when I asked for cancellation and refund it was immediately picked up within 12 hours. 1. You never had a replacement product. 2. You knew that this product was substandard (pack was June 2020. i,.e almost 2 yr old lying unsold in a godown in gujarat) and hence it was offered at an attractive price to clear it off. 3. Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works..Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service . Request to let it reach the head of CS. Tata Neu didnt live up to Neu. Nothing new in Neu."

Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works..Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service . Request to let it reach the head of CS. Tata Neu didnt live up to Neu. Nothing new in Neu."
34,refund,"I don't why tata neu think people will pay amount before they got product .. In many times the people got defective product ,the refund time will take atleast three to four days .. People may have insecurity wheather the amount will refunded or not"

34,refund,"I requested for return of a product received through Tata Cliq, ordered on Neu app. The app accepted my return request, but I did not receive any text or email confirmation. So I initiated the chat. I was informed that refund request was noted. However, no text or email confirmation was received till I logged on to Tata Cliq website after 2-3 days. I made the request on Th we website and only then did I receive the email and text confirmation. So it is apparent that while I can make an order on Neu app, rsturm canâ€™t be done on app."

Surprised to note that the good experience at the start turned out to be a nightmare. Issue is not the Curd or Rs. 47.25; it's the lack of coordination and problem solving. The delivery boy said that the item was spoilt/ bad. So refund would be initiated. Wonder! How the new app can be botched up by some, so soon. Not in conformity with Tata experience!!!!"

34,refund,"Being a Tata employee, we always believed in TATA commitment. We ordered a phone on 21st May by zip delivery options. Today being 25th May, we have not received a single call or mail from your sides regarding the problem. As a valued customer, I want a compensation regarding this order, as till date I have not received a mail regarding the delivery or refund of the money."
34,refund,"one of your croma representative convince to initiate refund in place of replacement my product. i told him that my neu coins validity is already expired so i can just replace my item but he promised me to return my neucoins with fresh validity if i am ready to refund instead of replacement. than he initiate refund on 20May22 .Now, neither i got my neucoins with fresh validity nor my old product."

34,refund,I am still waiting for the refund and there being no concrete time line
34,refund,I can't blame the customer service rep but she was not able to get my refund status from her system. Tata back end systems need to improve a lot.
34,refund,Neither there was a clarification provided on the reason for delay in refund nor the call back request from the concerned team materialised
34,refund,"Order returned, but no refund received. Worst service of all ecommerce."
34,refund,I have not received my total refundable amount. I have received o ly partial refund. Post that your team is silent about my pending refund amount of 234.82/- which I am deserveinng even after several mail communication.

35,user interface,Not a good application. Ur user interface is not still perfect 
35,user interface,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address..!!?? Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good."
35,user interface,"It's user interface is avarage type difficulty to bill payment and shipping, all products price is too high it's not good and there is no wallet option"
35,user interface,First the App user interface is not good it looks like all other websites api integration done on single page. Another major reason for low ratings is Neu donâ€™t give proper support for other partner issue like in my case from BIg Basket my order lost by delivery boy and Neu call center has no idea what to do and how to solve issue
35,user interface,"Please update Tata neu Payment system user interface should be quick or fast.at similar conditions other apps are quick (like phone pe, bhim)"
35,user interface,I am having trouble using the user interface. Itâ€™s not friendly as compared to the UI of the bigbasket app.
35,user interface,I have not received the product and it is shown as delivered no customer care no. Available. Bad experience. No option of complaint on the app. Only exchange option. Bad user interface. Bad experience will not rdcommend to anybody.
35,user interface,The Customer Service Representative do not have product knowledge and proper training has to be given to them. The user interface is ugly and support team is below average.
36,Neucoins,The credit of Neucoins is a long process of 7 days it is suggested that the same may be brought down.
36,Neucoins,"On Bigbasket order TataNeu gives 5% Neucoins on every order, but I have not received any NeuCoins on my Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022, please provide NeuCoins on Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022 - Mrs. Patva "
36,Neucoins,"Due to error in spelling of name ( your side) in my profile, could not book flight and lost out on Neucoins. This was my first attempt at using Tata Neu and hence discovered error now only. Had to book flights thru MMT"
36,Neucoins,"For something as straightforward as my issue (credit of Neucoins for a purchase at Croma store for which the copy of Physical receipt was provided to Customer Care), the amount of time it took to resolve the issue, is preposterous. Secondly, even after the issue was apparently resolved, I kept getting emails (I got at least 3) that it will take another 48 hours for the issue to be resolved. The entire thing seems extremely disjointed "
36,Neucoins,I am starting to hate Neucoins concept.
36,Neucoins,"As I said, there was no clear messaging on payment channel due to which your Neucoins earnings get affectedâ€¦didnâ€™t expect that from Tata brand at least .."
36,Neucoins,Horrible experience. Only 3 Neucoins were credited on an order value of Rs 1370 in Bigbasket. Till last month this was not the case.
36,Neucoins,Address searching through Google map is not functioning properly. Neucoins are not being credited on each transaction. Order status is not updated
36,Neucoins,"Issue remains unresolved, Neucoins not credited, offers are not transparent, stable and visible to the users during order placement."
36,Neucoins,"1) Prepaid Recharge function not working properly. 2) Tata Pay options not found in the payment menu. Somehow this important feature is missed. 3) In Big Basket Tata Neu payment option is not working. When we choose initially Cash on Delivery. 4) Neu Points should accept the decimals. Otherwise, the bill value should get convert to next higher number for us to use Neucoins. 5) Overall introduced in a hurry, always asking for a screenshot and it is really frustrating. 6) Hope someone at the top level sees the comment and take corrective action."
36,Neucoins,"Iâ€™ve already waited for 3+ days, thereâ€™s still no resolution. Ticket Id#732360. Haven't received Neucoins for my past 3 transactions on Croma amounting to 1,83,580/-"
36,Neucoins,Very poor customer service. Every time there is issue with Neucoins.
36,Neucoins,"Pathetic customer service. Very unprofessional. Neucoins take so much time to be credited. Why should customers have to pursue these basic things? The moment the order is delivered, the neucoins should be delivered. Also, looks like the support executives don't even know which offers are going currently."
36,Neucoins,My issue wrt the Neucoins was not solved properly
36,Neucoins,The issue is not yet resolved. None of the BigBasket Neucoins are reflecting in app. Please resolve the issue before requesting feedback.
36,Neucoins,Yet to receive Neucoins for my previous orders on Bigbasket
36,Neucoins,"Multiple complaints but still problem is not resolved.... BogBasket order on 30th April for 1770/- has still not been credited with 10% Neucoins... Pls dont keep sending me this feedback link, without first solving the problem"
36,Neucoins,"The process to credit NeuCoins to orders is not working properly. Automatic credit of Neucoins is not happening forcing me to raise the concern through your chat. I had complained twice and once it got resolved The second complaint is still waiting for resolution. The chatbot does not recognise the order numbers, forcing us to wait for an agent. The agents take their own time, leaving us to wait on them. If I do not respond fast enough, they disconnect. It is completely one sided transaction, with no concern for the customer."
36,Neucoins,Customer care team did not apply their mind to resolve the issue. It looks like they are sticking to the given script rather than solving the issue. I have not received Neucoins for the transaction with Air Asia apparently because one system takes into account middle name while the other does not. This is a very bad way of textual comparison. Even the government agencies understand this and it was never expected of a Tata company.
36,Neucoins,No resolution provided until now regarding Neucoins . Refer previous mail on the same subject .
36,Neucoins,My problem has not been resolved till date. Neucoins not credited for purchase at croma
37,customer care services,One of the best customer care services I have experienced.
37,customer care services,I really satisfied from customer care services Because she study my name and language and talking with Marathi language and I totally understand my solutions thank you again...? It's really best service
37,customer care services,"Your customer care services are too good ,but please make more updates in neu app , specially add light mode too ?"
38,Customer service desk,
39,Delivery boy,Delivery boy not coming to home and talking only mobile and not coming home.This is very bed .
39,Delivery boy,"Terrible first experience of placing the order. One order became COD and for next, the debited to my account and Delivery boy asking for the payment and hence I did not agree to pay and he took back. Now money not being returned. On Chat Box Customer Service is not responding too."
39,Delivery boy,Delivery boy rejected to accept exchange on 19th May 2022. I havc contacted your team on the same day. they could not help to cancel my order so that i can take another piece immediately. Even today its in return initiated state. Till now i didn't get my money back. where as other ecommerce like Amazon i was receiving my money immediately after initiating the return. TATA NEU needs to improve a lot in delivery and returns
40,Return process,Return process is not user friendly.. your app needs improvement.
41,app UI,Please improve app UI itâ€™s very confusing 
41,app UI,Improve the app UI. Currently its complicated and laggy
41,app UI,"The application feels sluggish, I used Big basket inside the app UI feels compromised."
42,Tata nu app,Tata nu app sucks
43,Tata Neu app,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
43,Tata Neu app,"Cannot expect such slow poor and delayed service from a Tata enterprise. Even the Tata Neu application has a lot of snags 
 "
43,Tata Neu app,"More than Customer care, it's the basic order processing & delivery issue, poor reflection of the status in your Tata Neu app. is the fundamental problem, Customer care can not handle the basic issues with order fulfillment & delivery."
43,Tata Neu app,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
43,Tata Neu app,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
43,Tata Neu app,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily
43,Tata Neu app,"Cromartie executive didn't know the details of Tata Neu app,how customers would benefit from the app."
43,Tata Neu app,"Tata Neu app is slow in my phone. Otherwise, I just have positive feedback."
43,Tata Neu app,Make Tata Neu app faster. It lags way too much to be usable.
43,Tata Neu app,Tata Neu app is a good initiative & offers great benifits to customer. Moreover it is very user friendly.
43,Tata Neu app,Sorry to say no one has called me nor have replied to my query. Contacting and communication was easy with Taj Inner Circle group earlier. Tata Neu app is horrible and cannot resolve or refer to specific questions .

Thanks and Regards, Priyanka Naidu TataNeu Customer Care 655948:1499020 Dear Sweta Kumari, I am really annoyed by the customer service done by Tata Neu. The list of service request (437707, 438417, 432141, 488218, 488219 and 495159) and trailing e mails. I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey.vikas3@tcs.com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

I am aghast to know â€œWe understand that due to some technical issue you got that error but we have done the required changes in your TataNeu profileâ€. I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure? What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch? What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue. As the 500 Neu Coins are â€œTataNeu Welcome NeuCoinsâ€ Request you to credit the same as soon as possible.

My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4. Why it for the golden copy that my other accounts of Big Basket (exiting) connected by my mobile number changed to corporate ID Thank you & Regards, Vikas Pandey From: TataNeu Sent: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 7:15 PM To: VIKAS PANDEY Subject: Help us serve you better.

43,Tata Neu app,"The representative explained it well, but not sure why offer on croma.com is not available from Tata Neu app"
43,Tata Neu app,Bad that policies are changed and you could buy directly from BB and get Tata Neu points and now you must from directly Tata Neu app but is not informed that this change has happened.
43,Tata Neu app,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
43,Tata Neu app,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
43,Tata Neu app,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
43,Tata Neu app,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
43,Tata Neu app,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
43,Tata Neu app,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
43,Tata Neu app,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
43,Tata Neu app,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
43,Tata Neu app,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
43,Tata Neu app,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
43,Tata Neu app,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
43,Tata Neu app,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
43,Tata Neu app,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.
43,Tata Neu app,I am awaiting my refund for the cancellation of hotel booking at Taj palace Delhi through Tata Neu app. It is more than 10 days and I havenâ€™t yet received my refund
43,Tata Neu app,"Even though promotion emails are disabled in the Tata Neu app, I still get promotional emails"
43,Tata Neu app,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish.

After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."

Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."
43,Tata Neu app,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
43,Tata Neu app,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
43,Tata Neu app,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
43,Tata Neu app,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
43,Tata Neu app,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
43,Tata Neu app,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
43,Tata Neu app,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."
43,Tata Neu app,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
43,Tata Neu app,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
43,Tata Neu app,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
43,Tata Neu app,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
43,Tata Neu app,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
43,Tata Neu app,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
43,Tata Neu app,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
43,Tata Neu app,Tata Neu app is dead slow
44,amazon,Pathetic experience as almost 4 days has been taken even after multiple follow ups and escalation for initiate refund. Where I see other merchants like Flipkart and amazons are providing instant refund.
44,amazon,Worse service..amazon flipkart is great in solving issues in a jiffy
44,amazon,I chatted on Neu it redirected me to Cliq customer care who in turn directed me to tata luxe .... and in all cases it was pathetic... have uninstalled the app as I now no longer find value in it... amazon rocks
44,amazon,"The app needs lot of improvement, hangs, lags a lot. Not user friendly. Customer care needs to be efficient. Bad experience while shopping. More than half of my orders got cancelled without notice. Have a look at amazon, flipkart. Better offers, better app. I have love for tata brand, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m using this app. Otherwise itâ€™s not worth. Everybody i know has same feedback."
44,amazon,"Jab se neu lauch Hua he tabase har chiz jo iss application se ho sakti he vo sab me neu se hi try karta Hu. Kyun ki ye TATA ki application he. But Kahi bar problems aate he. Flipkart, amazon or paytm low network me bhi jitne achchhe se load hote he Itne achchhe se neu nahi Hota ne. Iske alava application background bhi it itna effective nahi he ise or better banaya ja sakta he .. dusre application se compare karke aap NEU ko or better Bana sakte he.. "
44,amazon,Your tata neu application is very good interface but loading time taken too much time....and add more services  there....kindly follow flipkart amazon or best interface...so more customers can easily purchase sir...also pls expand your service to all the  main areas ....mainly your products are cheap rate...but customer can't purchase...because delivery service not available for many places...today all the customer need delivery for there home....then you can earn more profit...Till last 3 years i m trying to purchase from your company but can't ... We need delivery service here sir... kindly do the needful
44,amazon,Give your website team a tight slap on there face . What shit web page have they made on both Tata neu and Croma  it always loads  only while opening them . Make Tata neu and Croma reachable more by delivering to all locations in india foreign companies like amazon are delivering at all india level but you are not delivering . 
44,amazon,Worst experience and worst app I ever came across. Smallest of small companies handle better than your multi billion dollar company. Pathetic experience. I shouldn't have trusted and just gone through amazon. False promise of neucoins just to debit them after sometime with silly excuses.
44,amazon,Very disappointing customer care and delivery of item is delayed from the promised time very pathetic service i will prefer amazon or flipkart before yours service i will never order and item from you just give me what i had ordered on time
44,amazon,my suggestion is that all purchases and payments made using the app should be emailed to the customer. when i make utility bill payments from amazon pay i always get a receipt or confirmation of payment. this feature is missing on your app and it is necessary for record purposes. kindly implement the same. thank you and best wishes to the TATA family.
44,amazon,"I will recommend because i have faith in TATA If product is not available on your App. People will go here and there , you are competing Amazon , I have a suggestion please add local shopkeepers on this app like amazon and you will see the best result with in a month, If not then customer eill find 1 time 2time on your app thats it , if product still out of stoct , then we have to buy from Amazon. Please think about it"
44,amazon,"the issue was , why electricity bill was not paid when the money already debit from my debit card.... well as per tata neu, i will get refund in next 5 days.... lets see... and what about the payments.... if for the payment i have to switch to amazon as it clearly shows that tata neu app is not able to paying the bill then why i need tata neu app?"
44,amazon,"Include more products in each & every category! There are a lot of commercial products missing in ur super app! I was searching for gym equipments like resistance band, pull up bar etc. But I couldn't find any of them except tread mill & few others! There is no other options left for us than amazon & Flipkart!"
44,amazon,"Not sure , I have ordered Croma ac as part of flash deal label on Neu app which was later cancelled , as i felt cheated by Tataâ€™s . the same product was available on another 2 platform amazon and TataCLiQ with exactly same price and sold by croma with free standard installation. Whereas when I inquired at Neu chat support they told me I need to pay installation charges. When the seller is same , brand is company owned , you are labelling it under flash sale then why such discrepancies across channel. Never expected this kind of unethical practice from brand Tata"
44,amazon,"I placed request for my speakers and executives on call talked like I'm the one complaing without any merit to my problem and kept saying that it can't be taken back and kept refusing to send up a pick up team and made a request to speaker company for repairing rather than arranging for a pickup. I used to shop at amazon and I tried Croma for the 1st time just because I love the TATA, now this seems to be turning as nightmare for me atleast. SR27042200618"

44,amazon,"customer service call was having a annoying background system generated tone the product order was not cancelled by me but it was told so and shown in message via mail no body bothers to verify why it was cancelled the refund is very slow the app big basket and neu looks nothing as compared to amazon, i dont know why i decided to choose TATA instead for regular AMAZON ORDERS this is half ready product with lots of bugs"
44,amazon,I was asking can I use international credit card I didnâ€™t respond and I can use on amazon but Tata I canâ€™t
45,flipkart,Worse service..amazon flipkart is great in solving issues in a jiffy

45,flipkart,"Useless app, you can't change of your name, too much payment failure, I am gonna uninstall it totally waste of time, Amazon, flipkart is far better than this useless scrab"
45,flipkart,The app is not updating my bigbasket activity or updating invoices to add Neu coins. For every single transaction I have had to reach out to customer care to update the coins. What needs to fixed is the app so I donâ€™t have to reach out after every transaction. This is frustrating..if I have to reach out every time for a few Neu coins I would rather just order on Amazon or flipkart etc through HDFC smartbuy
46,Bigbasket order,"On Bigbasket order TataNeu gives 5% Neucoins on every order, but I have not received any NeuCoins on my Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022, please provide NeuCoins on Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022 - Mrs. Patva "

47,NeuCoins,"My query is still not resolved, my NeuCoins is not refunded yet. "
47,NeuCoins,I was told you cannot earn NeuCoins for westside purchases. While your App says you can. 
47,NeuCoins,"As, of now. No
My concern was 250 NeuCoins.
As I discussed with excutive, I will be eligible if purchased thorough Tata Neu before 21st.
I hope I will earn."
47,NeuCoins,"I tried to explain to each agent that I had not cancelled the Croma Order after paying the total amount by Credit Card and that there was a fraud being committed at either Croma or in the NeuCoins department of Tata Neu, but nobody has taken it seriously. I have bee defrauded of 120 - 6 = 114 New Coins"
47,NeuCoins,"There is a fraud happening where the customers NeuCoins are deducted even though the customer had not cancelled any order. I have asked every agent to connect me to the Fraud Department, but I am yet to hear from the Fraud Team. It is frustrating to repeat the issue to a new agent everyday."
47,NeuCoins,There is a fraud happening with NeuCoins being stolen from the customers
47,NeuCoins,"My query was about NeuCoins which can be redeemed only after 11-7-2022. However, this earned NeuCoins was not reflecting in the application. Hence my query on the same. Request application to show all NeuCoins earned including locked one. Executive informed that same will be reflected from 11-07-2022. Application can have total NeuCoins earned, locked NeuCoins, and redeemable NeuCoins."
47,NeuCoins,The customer care team did a great job of addressing my concern regarding the NeuCoins

47,NeuCoins,"Iâ€™m inviting you to TataNeu! Guess what? Iâ€™ve been shopping and earning rewards on TataNeu and I want to share this rewarding world with you! Click, sign up, and get 200 NeuCoins. Use them to shop because 1 NeuCoin = â‚¹1! Hurry, your referral code bgnaoz3n expires on 23/04/2022. Click https://neu.in/AzbaDIbv3ob You sent me this and made me install.. But you don't give neucoins... Tata neu cheating customers."
47,NeuCoins,"Customer service executive was good. But, abruptly cut the call. However the issue is with NeuCoins. Itâ€™s advertised as 5% across the app but has hidden terms and conditions. Thatâ€™s misleading"
47,NeuCoins,My problem still has not been resolved which was about NeuCoins not being migrated from the Tata 1 mg base platform. The CSR are unable to resolve the issue on the spot i.e. credit the missing NeuCoins.....instead they just keep saying on every call that they will pass on the details to the Technical team who will get back in 72 hours. SO IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO GET AN ISSUE RESOLVED
47,NeuCoins,"There is a lack of clear information & communication regarding placing orders & NeuCoins reward through TataNeu Portal since itâ€™s redirecting to multiple portals (such as Croma, TataCLiQ, BigBasket, etc.). So the time taken to resolve query & level in the quality meter atleast upto which a concern has to be properly resolved is definitely a miss !!"
47,NeuCoins,My issue of non-crediting of Referral NeuCoins was not resolved on call. Looking forward to early resolution of my complaint...PVS
47,NeuCoins,I have contacted the Service team for the query multiple times. I have still not been awarded NeuCoins.
47,NeuCoins,Tata Neu Payment Service NOT WORKING Properly ....Debit Card Payment combined with NeuCoins FAILS invariably ......if payment made using Debit Card BUT NO NeuCoins included then Payment will go thru .......seems yours payment system doesn't like us to use NeuCoins ...
47,NeuCoins,My Tata 1mg wallet balance of Rs 22.92 has not yet been transferred to Tatneu account as NeuCoins though Tata 1mg App shows migration done on 9th April. No resolution despite 6 calls to Tataneu customer support who keep mentioning that team is working on the issue(though sleeping will be more appropriate) and it will be resolved in 24-72 hours. I have to order my repeat prescription and requested that amount be manualy credited to my account pending resolution. Customer Support has become a joke with no access to responsible person. Shame on Tata Group including TCS in launching such a bad product.
47,NeuCoins,No NeuCoins credited yet
47,NeuCoins,I had ordered on 18 April which was completed on 22 April due to one national shipment.The order was of Rs.1200 plus but I have got only 5% NeuCoins instead of 10% . They have given following reasons for not giving 10% . Payment not done by credit card. Your order is in two parts. This show that they have no knowledge of national shipment. They have no knowledge of your advertisement primary tagline that is get 10% NeuCoins on minimum order of Rs.1200. They had asked for snapshot of the advertisement.They also asked to mail the order dated 18 April. Till now I have not received the remaining 5% NeuCoins. Today I have also placed a order which has been divided into two parts which will be delivered tomorrow and national shipment on 5 May.
47,NeuCoins,Actually I was foxed by the tagline of your advertisement stating get 10% NeuCoins on minimum order of 1200.My order was of Rs.1200 plus but as there was Rs. 12 in my BB WALLET ( which is also my money) and I paid the rest amount of Rs.1188.12 by debit card I have been denied the additional benefit of 5% Newcoins which is not justice.
47,NeuCoins,10% NeuCoins NOT received for orders in Big basket despite sending several emails
47,NeuCoins,"One of my minor issue with regards to credit of NeuCoins against my stay at Taj, MG road has not been resolved since one month."
47,NeuCoins,"Dear Team, NeuCoins is not credit in My Wallet also returning period is pass away."
47,NeuCoins,"The process to credit NeuCoins to orders is not working properly. Automatic credit of Neucoins is not happening forcing me to raise the concern through your chat. I had complained twice and once it got resolved The second complaint is still waiting for resolution. The chatbot does not recognise the order numbers, forcing us to wait for an agent. The agents take their own time, leaving us to wait on them. If I do not respond fast enough, they disconnect. It is completely one sided transaction, with no concern for the customer."
47,NeuCoins,Twice I ordered from BigBasket using TataNeu and both times I had to raise a complaint for not receiving NeuCoins. First ticket was resolved in a timely manner but the second one is still pending. Solving it again should be simple enough but I was told it will be resolved in 72 hours. It has been more than 5 days now.
47,NeuCoins,Usage of NeuCoins is a hassle. The shortcomings in using these coins far outweigh the benefits.
47,NeuCoins,10% NeuCoins were promised on two of my orders but I've only received 5%. Complaint was raised last week that was supposed to be sorted in 72 hours but time frame is over and still waiting for pending NeuCoins. Swapnil kept asking me to wait but wasnt able to give time frame as to when will I have an update as it's already pending from last week. Swapnil kept repeating that I'll get an update ASAP but no time frame even when I kept asking for it. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
47,NeuCoins,I wanted to know how to use NeuCoins. Your representative kept quiet for some minutes. I reminded him about my queries. He took too much time to reply. Perhaps he couldn't grasp the subject of my queries. I got impatient and preferred to quit.
47,NeuCoins,"Every time I make a transaction on Qmin, I have to run behind the customer help desk to get the eligible NeuCoins. It never comes automatically. And every time it takes more than 10 days for the lethargic and pathetic customer care to resolve such petty issues. Extremely bad experience"
47,NeuCoins,For no reason whatsoever my NeuCoins was debited for stays in Taj Rishikesh and Taj Rambagh. No one has come back to me and I will again struggle to get this resolved... Not expected from Tata even though there can be teething troubles.
47,NeuCoins,I ordered a few things on May 17. I was charged 788 NeuCoins but the delivery man collected Rs. 789 from my wife on delivery on May 18 What system is this?
47,NeuCoins,Haven't received NeuCoins for a Taj stay Which ended on 29-Apr-2022. Worst experience... False promises...
48,Neucoins,The credit of Neucoins is a long process of 7 days it is suggested that the same may be brought down.
48,Neucoins,"On Bigbasket order TataNeu gives 5% Neucoins on every order, but I have not received any NeuCoins on my Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022, please provide NeuCoins on Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022 - Mrs. Patva "
48,Neucoins,"Due to error in spelling of name ( your side) in my profile, could not book flight and lost out on Neucoins. This was my first attempt at using Tata Neu and hence discovered error now only. Had to book flights thru MMT"
48,Neucoins,"For something as straightforward as my issue (credit of Neucoins for a purchase at Croma store for which the copy of Physical receipt was provided to Customer Care), the amount of time it took to resolve the issue, is preposterous. Secondly, even after the issue was apparently resolved, I kept getting emails (I got at least 3) that it will take another 48 hours for the issue to be resolved. The entire thing seems extremely disjointed "
48,Neucoins,I am starting to hate Neucoins concept.
48,Neucoins,"As I said, there was no clear messaging on payment channel due to which your Neucoins earnings get affectedâ€¦didnâ€™t expect that from Tata brand at least .."
48,Neucoins,Horrible experience. Only 3 Neucoins were credited on an order value of Rs 1370 in Bigbasket. Till last month this was not the case.
48,Neucoins,Address searching through Google map is not functioning properly. Neucoins are not being credited on each transaction. Order status is not updated
48,Neucoins,"Issue remains unresolved, Neucoins not credited, offers are not transparent, stable and visible to the users during order placement."
48,Neucoins,"1) Prepaid Recharge function not working properly. 2) Tata Pay options not found in the payment menu. Somehow this important feature is missed. 3) In Big Basket Tata Neu payment option is not working. When we choose initially Cash on Delivery. 4) Neu Points should accept the decimals. Otherwise, the bill value should get convert to next higher number for us to use Neucoins. 5) Overall introduced in a hurry, always asking for a screenshot and it is really frustrating. 6) Hope someone at the top level sees the comment and take corrective action."
48,Neucoins,"Iâ€™ve already waited for 3+ days, thereâ€™s still no resolution. Ticket Id#732360. Haven't received Neucoins for my past 3 transactions on Croma amounting to 1,83,580/-"
48,Neucoins,Very poor customer service. Every time there is issue with Neucoins.
48,Neucoins,"Pathetic customer service. Very unprofessional. Neucoins take so much time to be credited. Why should customers have to pursue these basic things? The moment the order is delivered, the neucoins should be delivered. Also, looks like the support executives don't even know which offers are going currently."
48,Neucoins,My issue wrt the Neucoins was not solved properly
48,Neucoins,The issue is not yet resolved. None of the BigBasket Neucoins are reflecting in app. Please resolve the issue before requesting feedback.
48,Neucoins,Yet to receive Neucoins for my previous orders on Bigbasket
48,Neucoins,"Multiple complaints but still problem is not resolved.... BogBasket order on 30th April for 1770/- has still not been credited with 10% Neucoins... Pls dont keep sending me this feedback link, without first solving the problem"
48,Neucoins,"The process to credit NeuCoins to orders is not working properly. Automatic credit of Neucoins is not happening forcing me to raise the concern through your chat. I had complained twice and once it got resolved The second complaint is still waiting for resolution. The chatbot does not recognise the order numbers, forcing us to wait for an agent. The agents take their own time, leaving us to wait on them. If I do not respond fast enough, they disconnect. It is completely one sided transaction, with no concern for the customer."
48,Neucoins,Customer care team did not apply their mind to resolve the issue. It looks like they are sticking to the given script rather than solving the issue. I have not received Neucoins for the transaction with Air Asia apparently because one system takes into account middle name while the other does not. This is a very bad way of textual comparison. Even the government agencies understand this and it was never expected of a Tata company.
48,Neucoins,No resolution provided until now regarding Neucoins . Refer previous mail on the same subject .
48,Neucoins,My problem has not been resolved till date. Neucoins not credited for purchase at croma
49,TataNeu,"Very much disappointed by the solutions provided by the Tata 1 mg Customer Care Teams.

1) I reached your team through Chat option, they informed me to call your Toll Free Number

2) When I called on the Toll Free Number, they told me mail my request to TataNeu

3) When I emailed TataNeu, they informed me to contact you (Please find the attached screenshot of the email)

and now you say you are unable to delete that account.

REALLY VERY POOR SERVICE BY YOUR TEAM..."
49,TataNeu,"On Bigbasket order TataNeu gives 5% Neucoins on every order, but I have not received any NeuCoins on my Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022, please provide NeuCoins on Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022 - Mrs. Patva "
49,TataNeu,My real query was not resolved since the CC Exec didnâ€™t have an answer as to why prices/offers/discounts of items would be diff on TataNeu app & bigbasket app although both are under the Tata brand
49,TataNeu,"Hello, The query was resolved after a long time. Solution was not provided quickly despite explaining many times to different persons.

The Last Tataneu executive from back end team who called me, understood the problem and gave quick resolution

Thanks to TataNeu for providing solution."
49,TataNeu,"Query is pending for more than 3 weeks now.
Croma has closed the query several times without proper reasoning and no action taken by TataNeu team.
"
49,TataNeu,"Please help me understand that how the TataNeu app deducted the TataNeu Coins instantly, and at same time get a message that order has not been confirmed since payment failed. And I had to pay again where different amount got deducted. "
49,TataNeu,"TataNeu is cheater
I had ordered iPhone 13 with cashback offer but haven't received it till date."
49,TataNeu,"The TataNeu app is too slow, kindly improve the app, it needs to be much lighter & faster to operate on mobiles"
49,TataNeu,"The last rating is not for Priyanka.  It is for TataNeu customer care department as whole, because it took more than 6 days with no update from any one of my phone calls and emails."
49,TataNeu,"Hello, TataNeu - Live Chat, as well as the WhatsApp Support team, are not well trained, they're just arguing with the customers, and giving excuses to avoid the Customers reaching their Manager. I am not going to tolerate this kind of behavior, customer support service so I've decided to escalate this concern to the Board of Directors of TataNeu / Tata Digital as well as to the CEO of the Tata Group."
49,TataNeu,MY refund query was replied stating that I will receive it in TataNeu app wallet but I cannot find any wallet anywhere. Appreciate if someone can call and clarify again. Also my two mobile number possible merging concept was not known to executive and still not clarified
49,TataNeu,This was to check about the migration of my Taj Inner Circle membership points to TataNeupass before making a Taj booking.
49,TataNeu,No call came and no interaction was made with any TataNeu executive

49,TataNeu,Actually TataNeu Customer Excutive Promise Me Iâ€™ll Get My Remaining Coin And i Didnâ€™t Get And Last Employee Told Me You Are Not Eligible For 5% Offer I Have In Written Which Is Share By NeuCoin Employee Iâ€™m Eligible So How Iâ€™m Not Eligible For Offer If Possible Credit My Remaining Coin As Per 5% Contact Me For More Details Iâ€™m Talking About
49,TataNeu,The matter involves issues pertaining to Taj Inner Circle membership . TIC asked me to contact TataNeu who wants more information and would ideally want me to go back to TIC .
49,TataNeu,"There is a lack of clear information & communication regarding placing orders & NeuCoins reward through TataNeu Portal since itâ€™s redirecting to multiple portals (such as Croma, TataCLiQ, BigBasket, etc.). So the time taken to resolve query & level in the quality meter atleast upto which a concern has to be properly resolved is definitely a miss !!"
49,TataNeu,"I performed the necessary transaction on BigBasket via TataNeu app for 1200+ amount. And as per the listed promo on app, I expect 10% Tata Neu coins to be credited in my account, but I got ZERO for now. And worst there's no explanation for it."
49,TataNeu,I wrote the mail regarding the error I am getting while profile creating and while login into the TataNeu app. Not resolved still
49,TataNeu,The Representative promised to call back with a resolution but no resolution was given. I was only informed that my feedback would be shared with the higher-ups of the concerned team. It was my first order with the TataNeu App and it was a disaster.
49,TataNeu,Really pathetic customer service from TataNeu. Neu coins are not credited even after multiple follow up. And TataNeu support executives are inept to resolve any concern.
49,TataNeu,"TataNeu app is not up to the mark. I don't even get the promised loyalty rewards (coins). Compared to your app, Amazon should be given 5 stars. (Here I must state that I hold shares in Tata companies - Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Teleservice - and I hope your app does well. )"
49,TataNeu,"I cancelled the order i placed in BigBasket. Think had been a customer for years with Bigbasket, coming of TataNeu will end this i think. There is no UPI payment facility. The customer service says it is there. I quit."
49,TataNeu,The problem is not with customer care representative. The problem is with TataNeu outlook. TataNeu should learn from Amazon for timely resolution.
49,TataNeu,My ac got delivered more than 3 days ago....no one has installed until now...9490174948 purchased from CROMA VIA TataNeu
49,TataNeu,Twice I ordered from BigBasket using TataNeu and both times I had to raise a complaint for not receiving NeuCoins. First ticket was resolved in a timely manner but the second one is still pending. Solving it again should be simple enough but I was told it will be resolved in 72 hours. It has been more than 5 days now.
49,TataNeu,"Worst customer support. No intention to help. Just repeat same answer like a Bot. TataNeu can never compete Amazon,Flipkart in next 100 years also."
49,TataNeu,CC executive was so lazy and have not proper knowledge about the app. Also she was unable to resolve my issue for my very first bill payment through TataNeu app. Still my bill is not credited to my merchant's account.
49,TataNeu,Called 3 times in 4 days for the same issue and still not satisfied with the support. Donâ€™t expect such pathetic support from TataNeu.
49,TataNeu,"I still have a problem with booking taj mahal tower room through TataNeu offer from taj site/app, TataNeu app for 11th june. i have tried numerous calls and emails to both taj and tataNeu, but havent got the solution yet. i have been trying to book since last 5 days. I am quite frustated at this point. Whenever i try to book, the page keeps on loading. i have given up at this point. from the first day i have been getting the same answer â€˜technical team is working on itâ€™ everyone just keeps forwarding the call to another person and the cycle repeats. i still dont have a solution for the problem faced."
49,TataNeu,"My Qmin order from the Hotel Mint, Bangalore was not delivered and the refund is not processed even after the deadline of 7 working days. None from the customer service knows what is the exact status of my refund and who from TataNeu app or Qmin or Mint has to approve my refund"
49,TataNeu,"My Qmin order from the Hotel Mint, Bangalore on May 14th was not delivered and the refund is not processed even after the deadline of 7 working days. None from the customer service knows what is the exact status of my refund and who from the TataNeu app or Qmin or Mint has to approve my refund. I fail to understand why the multiple related tickets raised were closed in a hurry on reaching the time deadline, though there is no resolution to the main issue and is pending beyond any official or reasonable timeline"
49,TataNeu,The app is not properly developed. You cannot distinguish which app the order was placed from. I placed from TataNeu but your system says BB. Your executive implied im lying or im delusional. You people need to accept there can be a technical errors on your new app. I am not kind of person to make stories for 50 neu coins. I have uninstalled the app and I won't recommend it anyone only because you people fail to accept your mistakes and imply that the customer is a liar. Its not about the coins but because you your Ccare people don't listen and accept that there can be a problem.
50,Home delivery,Your website is slow. Home delivery is must for electronics and power banks etc
51,neu coins,No one understand my problem/query. No one took efforts to resolve it. First the employee in Croma Chandigarh have no knowledge. They are not conform me about how i get neu coins. All employees are full  lack of knowledge/ schemes

Here in my case no third party or bank was involved , only tata's products were involved. Still it took 10 days to resolve the query. Qorst service by TATA. Thus is my second experience regarding TATA products where first and second level cystomer services are very poor. Previously a year ago i had to contact up to the level of the CEO of tata aia insurance for solution of my query related to my health policy."
51,neu coins,"Taken me 30 days to refund the neu coins because the order was cancelled by tataneu themselves
Worst coustemer service ever"
51,neu coins,return my neu coins 
51,neu coins,"I placed my order from CROMA only because the product was not showing on the TATA NEU APP, but the points credited to me were 0.33% instead of 5% (as claimed by TATA NEU) even though croma being a TATA company. No where was it mentioned that the purchase has to be made with tata neu app, and nowhere it was mentioned that croma will give only 0.33% neu coins. Its disappointing and unacceptable. "
51,neu coins,"Tata neu app payment process is not proper ,this has happened two times earlier,
Particularly when we use payment by adjusting neu coins it is getting stuck and payment fails.pl look into this i could not get solution to this , ultimately i had to pay by agreeing to  cash on delivery without adjusting neu coins."
51,neu coins,"After 6 days, wrong reason given for not giving cashback as neu coins"
51,neu coins,"Apurva was amazing, she helped me with the query with the right resolutions. She also guided me about the tata neu coins and whats the use of it. She is a star âœ¨"

I raised the issue immediately with the customer care but no one has any solution to that issue. It has been almost 20 days since that problem occurred. The customer care is only asking for 72 hours each time and they are incapable of resolving that. Transaction id is TC300026459899.
51,neu coins,after giving multiple screenshots and follow up still 5% neu coins not credited.

51,neu coins,"There has been lot gap /confusion in terms of how to earn neu coins. Plus the NeuApp also is not great performance wise if you try to navigate to any partner app like BB, Tatacliq, etc from neu app itself, thereby impacting the overall experience badly. Happy to share/connect more inputs if reached out to."
51,neu coins,I asked about my whereabouts of 5 percent of neu coins of delivered order of BB . But I didnt get any response.
51,neu coins,Didn't receive 200 neu coins even after following the procedure
51,neu coins,"Very late response there should be toll free number and voice assistant for better clarification of offers , theres no tata neu coins on purchase from offline store"
51,neu coins,But still neu coins not credited
51,neu coins,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
51,neu coins,"It will take lot of time for customers executives respons so,I have disconnected the chat. My query is stills pending. My question when did I received my neu coins back for I have returned Item itâ€™s been 4 Days. Can you please help me on this"
51,neu coins,I was told that o would get remaining neu coins but didnt get any
51,neu coins,This is bad you should give 5% neu coins when u buy in other tata apps and not restricted to tata neu app
51,neu coins,Not resved my issue tata neu coins not resved 7 billing issue 5% tata neu coins
51,neu coins,1st of all the app needs huge performance improvements. It is very slow. 2nd I had 500 neu coins when I tried to use it that time it did not happen and finally when I had thr option to use it then you guys are saying it had expired.
51,neu coins,"I didn't get my neu coins, I refered to my friend"
51,neu coins,Add neu coins on UPI payments also and also give some reward when I refer to my friends.other wise app is good.
51,neu coins,No extra neu coins 5% extra on tata cliq
51,neu coins,I have been following up for last 7 days for tataneu coins to be credited for my stay at Taj bengal on 18-20 March 2022 and so far it has not been resolved from your end
51,neu coins,No resolution provided. I was not told how to make use of neu coins properly and also my deducted money wasn't returned to bank account.
51,neu coins,"The issue is not resolved and every time we make a transaction which is eligible for neu coins, we need to email and follow up. None in customer care is aware"
51,neu coins,I havenâ€™t received neu coins for my last purchases worth 70000. Order id SOA092000472591
51,neu coins,"Still my tata1mg points is not converted in tataneu coins,"
51,neu coins,He not give me proper answer I m asking about my neu coins my purchase date is before launch date that time we gate 5% neu coins from both place store & application but he told me other options
51,neu coins,After many communication my neu coins not received
51,neu coins,There should be a proper sheet or way from where we can also know about the complete information regarding migrated 1mgcash amount and we should have the right to track neu coins.
51,neu coins,My 1mg cash 770 and 90 has not been migrated to neu coins . And then Your complain referance number is 702002 has not resolved till now
51,neu coins,Query was not clarified and misinformation about neu coins that you get minimum assured coins on transactions via tata neu app or web. The customer service agent was not aware of the fact written in faq that neu coins are assured on all transactions via tata neu app
51,neu coins,Where are neu coins and the cliqcash ?
51,neu coins,I am using 1 mg from past 2 years. Never faced this issue and recommended this to many. But this time the service is unsatisfactory. My 1mg coins were deducted automatically and not converted into neu coins. I am mailing since so many days and talked to customer care as well but query not resolved.
51,neu coins,My 1mg cash was migrated for neu coins but never reached it. Also it's impossible to reach 1mg support. What is the idea of ordering online for medicine when 3 of them were cancelled and not provided any alternative and ultimately we need to go to market to hunt for those medicines.
51,neu coins,"Iam very upset with Tata Neu, i used to earn good number of coins while using BB app. Now it has suddenly stopped stating i need to buy through Tata Neu? was there any communication???????????????? i have placed 2 orders 1632/- and 1225/- where i was supposed to earn 10% extra neu coins. I received a message that 10% additional coins would be added to my account. Now i have received a message that it was wrongly stated i will not be getting the coins !!!!!!! is this a joke?"
51,neu coins,"Tata brand doesnâ€™t need to get into coercive methods to ensure stickiness for its brand, so itâ€™s disappointing that you are resorting to it! Eg ok 1MG why would you force users to pay through your wallet only instead of usual gpay to be able to avail neu coins redemption. Also if I want to exit as a customer out or Tata neu you donâ€™t even have a process that ensures my data is deleted at your end nor does your team know anything about it"
51,neu coins,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
51,neu coins,still no solution of neu coins. not credited even after 9 days.
51,neu coins,Your offer says 10% neu coins on order above 1200 but not yet received
51,neu coins,I had a query on the offer on Big basket for which I received an email which said that you get 10% tata neu coins when you shop at Bigbasket using the Tata neu app. However I received only 5%. On reaching the customer care she was not clear on the offer. She mentioned that I would not get any coins as I paid using existing neu coins which I feel is incorrect.
51,neu coins,"I had made full payment through net banking mode for an order from big basket. I received a torn packet of Ashirwad atta, so requested for a replacement. Got my replacement on the same day but my neu coins were deducted. Through the chat menu got to know that neu coins were used to make payment."
51,neu coins,I send to Money transfet to other contact number but not no credit neu coins
51,neu coins,The customer is not good they donâ€™t reply on time my problem is not yet solved regarding tata neu coins. Whats the point of joining if the very thing I downloaded it for is not getting it on time.
51,neu coins,Issues with neu coins crediting system. Especially with the purchase done on CROMA
51,neu coins,"I didn't receive the neu coins for the flight tickets that I booked through the TATA Neu app, The Flight was initially booked by TATA Neu, however, the flight got Rescheduled by Air Asia, As per the customer care , it is Air Asia's fault that i couldn't get Neu Coins This is not a behavior that is Expected from a TATA Group Company, If it is the Response of the Group employees then what would be with others. You are requested to Resolve these issues and take this instance as learning."

51,neu coins,I have purchased 6 products and lowest profit value is 38k+ and same has been captured in your system. Also all the product values are mentioned by your team in tickets. However neu coins are not credited in my account yet. Customer service provide same answer as team is working. I really don't understand what kind of investigation they are doing and what Information you need. If you don't provide service and offer to your customer on time please don't promise.... I will stop using tata neu if I don't get response in next 48hrs.
51,neu coins,I have booked the flights. Because of name mismatch i am not eligible for neu coins. What's wrong in it if i use kumar in my name or not. That's my full name. I strongly disagree with the solution. This is my first and last booking with tata neu app. I am not going to use it anymore. Even i am Going to delete it now.
51,neu coins,"This app used to lagg very much and secondly, i have 130 neu coins in my neupass but day after that when i see my neu coins it shows error and zero balance in neu pass and iam unable to use neu coin in Tata 1Mg."

51,neu coins,App need update regarding neu coins statement and neu coins balance
51,neu coins,"People have said that their past orders were considered for neu coins, however I was told only for future orders. Not sure whom to believe"
51,neu coins,"TATA NEU don't have many basic features like UPI payment option while ordering anything. Terms & conditions are not clearly mentioned fir neu coins. It's biggest confusing thing. App is so laggy. It takes some times more than 5-10 secs to open new page which irritates customer if we have many other smooth other alternative apps available. We are here only for the name of TATA. Don't ruin the name of TATA by making such bad product. It seems app was launched without any preparations & there is no common sense. How can you miss UPI payment option for orders, seriously?"
51,neu coins,My ticket 671039 is still not resolved as I have got only 1207 neu coins as against 2277 neu coins whic was entitled for a spend of Rs 9108 at Taj Bengal. Have submitted all invoices as the offer clearly states 25% neucoins. Pls credit the balance 1070 coins in my account at the earliest and confirm
51,neu coins,I will use it lifetime with free shipping and neu coins system. Awesome ?
51,neu coins,Neu coins for latest order dated 22/04/2022 not credited though orders of nov 2021 to march 2022 earned neu coins. Logic not understood from TATA e- commerce group
51,neu coins,Customer service was not upto mark.. plz tell how to use neu coins..
51,neu coins,Representative could not understand what my problem was in the first place And my problem is still not resolved The problem was that I did not recieve 10% tata neu coins for my big basket orders. I have placed 2 big basket orders above 1200 so far. I recieved only 5% coins on one order and zero on the second order
51,neu coins,"Issue is still not resolved, not receiving neu coins for my purchases"
51,neu coins,Bought through Tata Neu at bigbasket on promo stated that 10% neu coins would be awarded if purchase over 1200. Coins did not get credited for 72 hours post which grievance raised - neu got back stating 5% crecited in neu account and balance 5% if not credited one should get in touch with bigbasket??? How does bigbasket have ability to credit neu coins for a tata neu customer??? Why should tata neu holder chase bugbasket for 5% credit???
51,neu coins,Where is my neu coins . I purchased through tata neu app rs 2k but I didn't receive neu coin
51,neu coins,"It is disappointing to see Tata not walking the talk when it comes to credit of Neu coins. I had spent ~42k exclusive of taxes on a booking in IHCL. As per the advertisement, I should have received 5% of the credit in terms of Neu coins. I only got 1368 neu coins against 2100 going by simple math."
51,neu coins,Make available use of neu coins for bill payment also.
51,neu coins,Processes are not properly laid down and systems not tuned as per laid down process. Did 2 transactions and didn't get neu coins automatically. I had raise complaints which took more than 3 days to resolve that too after reminders. One is yet to be resolved.
51,neu coins,"It has been more than 10 days, not getting neu coins for 6 of my transactions even after complaining several times to customer care. Ticket id #912490"

51,neu coins,"Even writing for 5 times, 10% neu coins on order on bisbsket through tata neu app, neu coins not credited. Last order, even 5% coins not given ."
51,neu coins,Issue was that neu coins not awarded for Air Asia as middle name was not updated in Tata Neu profile. I find this very rigid and inflexible. And ways to find excuse to not give neu coins.
51,neu coins,my neu coins is still not credited
51,neu coins,"I guys never credit the eligible neu coins on time, it's like we hv to beg u to do so. Disgusting service"
51,neu coins,"Details are hidden in Terms and condition, locking periods are no where mentioned, no transparency! all of sudden refund is initiated for an order. migration of 1mg cash to neu coins are not done properly ( simple 5th standard do better calculation )"
51,neu coins,"I got 2 neu coins instaed of 5% as you advertise, which is a mockery of the customer. for bill amount of 750 @5% i should have got 37 points. bad experience"
51,neu coins,"Me being the TCS employee, I feel really disappointed for using tata Neu and also feeling bad for recommending it to my friends. I reached out to tata neu chat support and twitter support as I didnt get the neu coins for the product I purchased from croma store on May 6th (Invoice:SLA095001514772). Almost 10 days. no point in reaching out to customer care. I dare how they send for customer service feedback without resolving the issue."
51,neu coins,Not at all satisfied for the resolution...I need to get 10% neu coins. But got only 5%...
51,neu coins,"I did not receive 5% neu coins after ordering grocery worth 850 from tata neu app. Customer care told â€˜Sir there is nothing we can do about this, our system is showing you did not order from tata neuâ€™ This is the resolution I received Good luck to tata neu team."
51,neu coins,Tata neu coins earned by me through Big Basket transactions are not reflected in my account.

51,neu coins,I have still not received neu coins for my order that id is SOA250001533892
51,neu coins,Mujhe message Aya ki 75 neu coins have been credited to your account per wo coins credit nehi hua he Jab me customer care executive se pucha wo kuch thik nehi bata pa rehe hai
51,neu coins,You people are cheaters. I lost my 278 neu coins... You people not value your customers. I requested a lot many times to provide my coins but you people did not. I quit here. I am not going to use your app further. I will use pharmeasy for my orders.
51,neu coins,I lost my neu coins for failed transaction and representative is not able to understand and it takes hell lot of time to respond
51,neu coins,While beeing a tata employee when all my co workers got 75 neu coins i didn't receive the same also your tool free number doesnt work
51,neu coins,my problem not yet resolved regarding tata neu coins
51,neu coins,"I am unable to pay using Tata neu coins, when ever we place an order on tata neu using coins the order is being placed as cash on delivery. We have 998 coins when we place order it shows zero coins. WHY?"
51,neu coins,"So many terms and conditions for earning 5% neu coins. When asked for those, no response from the customer support."
51,neu coins,"30 April & 5 May I purchased from Croma Calicut around 90000rs ; Store team told me Tata neu coins will added within 15 days ; very disappointed to say nothing will credited from any where, itâ€™s very cheating from the Tata side, Calicut manager and sales team not support, No one knows offers or coins details, I have lots of Corparate orders, I want to purchase from Croma or any Tata concerns,but these types of ambiance and attitude No need future buy from Croma; Sales staff as billing staff ;need improve the knowledge of offers and neu coins , TATA is a major leading company in our country So sadly said that Customer satisfaction nothing. Sadly say that I will never purchase from Tata Croma anymore."
51,neu coins,I need my neu coins credited urgently Otherwise itâ€™s a Cheating. Dilshad-9633123457
51,neu coins,"It has been more than a month. My issue is still unresolved. The 3 ticket id have been generated for the same reason in the past 30+ days. I am yet to get my Neu coins for 5 purchases made on big basket. Now, recently i was asked to provide prrof of my purchase and that i didn't get neu coins, which i provided. Still, no resolution to the issue even after that."
51,neu coins,Waste service my 204 neu coins were not credited
51,neu coins,"I purchased a mobile phone from Tata neu app. Instead of getting 5 neu coins per 100, I got less. I also emailed a video (which I had to make as this thing has he opened earlier to me also) to the customer care team. It clearly shows I have purchased from Tata neu, still the customer care is disagreeing an saying that I have purchased from Croma website. If you see my history of purchases, I have been buying a lot of items from Tata neu. I am not happy with the current status of my problem. Tata neu has less varieties and higher costs in some items, still supporting the app as itâ€™s made in India. But if the customer care wonâ€™t support properly, I am not likely to suggest this to my friends. Thanks."
51,neu coins,The app lags too much. Many people have given this app worst ratings still the app developers doing nothing... Croma only have few electronic product comparing to other shopping brands. It's like you don't care about customer experience and just care about 5% neu coins.
51,neu coins,"Never will recommend Tata Neu. Will not make that mistake. Its been more than 3 weeks, i havent got my Tata neu coins so far. It has been a pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Made a big mistake booking Gateway Chikmaglur through Tata Neu. Didnt get the best price and also, was not aware the price didnt include food. It didnt even cover breakfast. Tata Neu booking hid this fact from me and didnt show the price with food included. Ended up paying a huge amount for 2 days stay. And to top it, didnt even get Tata Neu coins for it."
51,neu coins,"Very bad app , I have 100 Rupees amount in TATA neu coins But right now it's showing 0 Can I know the reason why there is no amount"
51,neu coins,"Very bad experience, I have 100 Rupees amount in TATA neu coins But right now it's showing 0 Can I know the reason why there is no amount"
51,neu coins,"one of your croma representative convince to initiate refund in place of replacement my product. i told him that my neu coins validity is already expired so i can just replace my item but he promised me to return my neucoins with fresh validity if i am ready to refund instead of replacement. than he initiate refund on 20May22 .Now, neither i got my neucoins with fresh validity nor my old product."
51,neu coins,still the neu coins are not reflecting in my account .
51,neu coins,The app is not properly developed. You cannot distinguish which app the order was placed from. I placed from TataNeu but your system says BB. Your executive implied im lying or im delusional. You people need to accept there can be a technical errors on your new app. I am not kind of person to make stories for 50 neu coins. I have uninstalled the app and I won't recommend it anyone only because you people fail to accept your mistakes and imply that the customer is a liar. Its not about the coins but because you your Ccare people don't listen and accept that there can be a problem.
52,Customer service,"Application improvement required (application is bulky & not user friendly & response time is high compare with others , important information & services tools need improvement with detailed information table etc.
Customer service improvement required
"
52,Customer service,Pathetic Customer service response seen in my lifetime
52,Customer service,Customer service agent is very co-operative and very intelligent about the knowledge.
52,Customer service,Customer service needs drastic improvement 
52,Customer service,"Customer service was absolutely useless, no help or resolution provided"
52,Customer service,Customer service vastly needs to be improved. 
52,Customer service,Customer service executives require proper training and small matters shouldn't take 48 hrs to be resolve. Complain took 2 weeks to be resolved but each and every customer service executive said it will take 48 hrs to be resolved every 48 hrs. Teach them how many hrs are there in a day. I don't think they don't know how to calculate 48 hrs
52,Customer service,"My 5th order was cancelled even after order successful status. I cant believe why they have created this app if no one can order. Customer service is pathetic, they are not listening to customer and saying you will get refund and place again fresh order. This is unacceptable as i have already tried 5 times with different payment mode."
52,Customer service,I don't recommend using tata neu app. Customer service is too bad.
52,Customer service,Customer service is good but i hope i will get my points after 15 days. as your executive say to me.
52,Customer service,"Pathetic and slow service. Customer service executive is only giving response from script without even checking the details. Hopeless, will not wish this on my enemy also"
52,Customer service,The Customer service executive took a lot of time and delayed the conversation
52,Customer service,"I need need a generalized invite link, so that more of my friends and family member can join through that link, unfortunately Customer service representative was not able to guide me through this."
52,Customer service,"Customer service executive should respond fast, lot of waiting time"
52,Customer service,"1. I was unable to connect with customer service.Customer service chat/WhatsApp/phone no was always busy 2. We can't connect to the same chat, If we move out and come back to the chat. 3. Font size should be reduced and make all the words should be single lined. 4.We should be having light theme as well."
52,Customer service,Customer service is very good and customer associat talking with my very polite and good behaviour.
52,Customer service,Customer service looked into wrong order which was done on 2nd April instead of Order done on 3rd April and marked my issue as resolved!!
52,Customer service,This boy tried helping me a lot. But this app seems to be problematic. Please improve ur app specially Bigbasket. Customer service is very good
52,Customer service,Customer service is not reachable and how can I complaint ?
52,Customer service,Customer service is Good but improve their knowledge...
52,Customer service,Customer service executive talk to me very nicely
52,Customer service,Customer service is good
52,Customer service,"Customer service executive was good. But, abruptly cut the call. However the issue is with NeuCoins. Itâ€™s advertised as 5% across the app but has hidden terms and conditions. Thatâ€™s misleading"
52,Customer service,"Customer service didn't understand my issue,even i thought they don't read my query properly."
52,Customer service,"Customer service and the CROMA store both work independently, NEU customer care representative should have access to order placed at store or on the app as well. It has been 5 days since i placed my order and till date nobody calls back to inform the status. Last time when I ordered using coins on the app, the product was delivered late and also was open. For past one month I am only trying to place order of echo dot."
52,Customer service,Customer service representative lacks basic knowledge
52,Customer service,Customer service needs much training. They r putting calls on long hold and have no knowledge on queries. What the app says and what the service member state are contradicting. Much improvement needed on this front.
52,Customer service,Good Customer service...
52,Customer service,Customer service is very poor
52,Customer service,Payment process was abruptly aborted automatically. Customer service representative was not having the information about this even though it was provided in the chat prior to the representative join the conversation. The response was also very slow.
52,Customer service,Customer service is not good
52,Customer service,"Customer service is very pathetic, they can only speak one thing rather than giving solution and that is please wait for some tiem"
52,Customer service,"Customer service support is too irritating, not able to understand and resolve query."
52,Customer service,I have purchase on 14.04.2022 and at the time placing order amount deduct but still refund not done. Customer service is saying wait for more time.
52,Customer service,I have purchased 6 products and lowest profit value is 38k+ and same has been captured in your system. Also all the product values are mentioned by your team in tickets. However neu coins are not credited in my account yet. Customer service provide same answer as team is working. I really don't understand what kind of investigation they are doing and what Information you need. If you don't provide service and offer to your customer on time please don't promise.... I will stop using tata neu if I don't get response in next 48hrs.
52,Customer service,"Customer service needs to be more swift.Hope in the future the service would be more quick and the app becomes more smoother without any lag and no payment issues.I would like to highlight one thing - Customer care call service is pathetic , it must be improved. 4 - 5 times I placed a call, one single guy took the call every time.He spoke in a regional language-hindi.I asked him to speak in english or give to someone who knows english so I can communicate easily.He refused and disconnected the call(after 2-3 attempts).First thing i guess there is insufficient people in the call service team since all the 4-5 times the same person spoke and second thing the person attending should sound polite or atleast sound professional.More than anything ""service"" is something important, which makes the customer visit again.If its not improved, then its difficult to sustain in the competitive environment.That too being from India's PROUD ""TATA"" brand, I wish to see this platform grow thousandfold and flourish successfully! So, please work on the customer service and improve the platform's issues/glitches that is present currently. from a RATAN TATA's Fan"
52,Customer service,"Customer service is worst , should be improve"
52,Customer service,We didn't receive Neu Coins as promised. I talked two times to customer care both did not solve my issue. Customer service is terrible. Kavita doesn't respond to me for five minutes. All are busy with own works not time to waste.
52,Customer service,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
52,Customer service,"I had complained that for three days, Big BaEsket was showing that all slots are full. Even 1 mg shows Somme medicines not available. In today's fast paced times when customers have wide choices, they will not wait for three days even if they are die hard fans. Even I had to order from local Kiran shops. Customer service gave us only generalised answers like we will look into your problem and try to solve it."
52,Customer service,Customer service was not upto mark.. plz tell how to use neu coins..
52,Customer service,I have been trying to resolve one issue for the last 3 days and I have always exchanged some 5 mails for the Same only because of the inefficiency of your Customer service person.. Pathetic attitude towards resolving customer issue
52,Customer service,"i have raised 3 tkts, all to do with a delayed delivery of my food order from QMin. i get a call back from customer service after 30-45 mts of logging a tkt. not possible to speak with anyone with immediately. No one answers Qmin toll free number. Food arrives late. No one even apologises. Customer service rep repats info i already know such as what time i placed an order, what i ordered , from where. they just tell me status of my order that even i can see from track order. Complete nonsense."
52,Customer service,Issue not resolved. Customer service have no knowlede or understand to resolve issues.
52,Customer service,Customer service person is well behaved
52,Customer service,"Customer service was poor. Takes 30+ mins TAT. Further, the T&C wasnt explicit wrt bookings to be in the name of the neupassholder to get credits. Those need to also be modified."
52,Customer service,Customer service is very good but you guys need to improve a lot on the app User interface. Not at all convenient and User friendly
52,Customer service,Customer service 3rd class response.. Your return pick up boy collected wrong. Product and arguments very baf
52,Customer service,"Even after raising my issue almost 8 days back, no update from Tata Neu team on my concern. Customer service executives are clueless."
52,Customer service,Customer service representative are not fully aware. Not gave correct answer regarding booking at Taj hotel. Also not received correct answer. Somewhat misguided

Why can't I rely on TATA...area of improvements are as follows:
1. Team should update order status on time
2. Customer care executive should be provided detailed information about logistic part
3. They should have ability to connect with internal team to know real cause of the issue
4. Your customer relationship manager must review each & call to know what is happening at ground level

54,TCS,"Worst service ever .. all what we hear is ""concern team is looking into and we will get back after. 72 hours"" .. no one is ready to take the responsibility and resolve the issue.. Use a good Ticket system like service now else ask TCS to improvise ur CRM

Secondly kindly define word PRIORITY and flash it on your Home page cz as a brand what ur agents say is not at all PRIORITY.. 

Tata neu could resolve the issue so finally i had to reach out to grievance officer to fix all my problems ..

54,TCS,Regarding the app - The ticket is in resolved status but no option to reopen as I still have queries Regarding customer care - again they have not addressed how my corporate benefits can be used on app as I know TCS employees are part of Tata group and get discount on most products on NEU so my question was how to use and response was no offers which is surely false ?

54,TCS,"Customer Service Representative not at all understanding my issue. I am still trying to reach them but they are not responding to my mail. As being a TCS employee, I really feel bad about the service provided by the TATA Neu platform."
54,TCS,My Tata 1mg wallet balance of Rs 22.92 has not yet been transferred to Tatneu account as NeuCoins though Tata 1mg App shows migration done on 9th April. No resolution despite 6 calls to Tataneu customer support who keep mentioning that team is working on the issue(though sleeping will be more appropriate) and it will be resolved in 24-72 hours. I have to order my repeat prescription and requested that amount be manualy credited to my account pending resolution. Customer Support has become a joke with no access to responsible person. Shame on Tata Group including TCS in launching such a bad product.
54,TCS,"BECAUSE OF YOUR INTERNAL ISSUES IN VARIOUS SYSTEMS, MY ORDERS ARE EITHER CANCELLED OR HAD TO RESCHEDULE. IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A PROPER SYSTEM IN 0LACE THEN PLEASE DO FOLLOWING - 1. CLOSE THIS APP IMMEDIATELY, 2. SHUTDOWN TCS AND OUTSOURCE THE APP TO SOMEONE ELSE IF YOU STILL WISH TO CONTINUE WITH THIS APP. BAD EXPERIENCE AND WORST PROMISES FROM TATA."
54,TCS,Expected better from tata neu and TCS team. My issue wasn't even resolved
54,TCS,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
54,TCS,"Me being the TCS employee, I feel really disappointed for using tata Neu and also feeling bad for recommending it to my friends. I reached out to tata neu chat support and twitter support as I didnt get the neu coins for the product I purchased from croma store on May 6th (Invoice:SLA095001514772). Almost 10 days. no point in reaching out to customer care. I dare how they send for customer service feedback without resolving the issue."
54,TCS,"Being a TATA employee twice in my lifetime upto now ,i am very much happy with their services...EX -TCS EMPLOYEE AND NOW TPCODL EMPLOYEE."
54,TCS,"Thirs Class service By TATA , you people are ruining MR RATAN TATA name nothing else. 45 days have been passe but you did not resolve a little proble whlie you run number 1 Computer technology company TCS, how you people work I do not know.

55,escalation matrix,"Your customer care executive is looking the order#TC300030608681 status in the application & provide me the details. I can very well see it. However, my issue was need to know why the above mentioned order was not delivered on time & why people are not updating? Due to this reason Amazon is doing better business than TATA. Why can't I rely on TATA...area of improvements are as follows:
1. Team should update order status on time
2. Customer care executive should be provided detailed information about logistic part
3. They should have ability to connect with internal team to know real cause of the issue
4. Your customer relationship manager must review each & call to know what is happening at ground level
5. TCS should upgarde their software according to business requirements must provide escalation matrix in the NEU apps"
55,escalation matrix,"Have been chasing customer care since 3 months now, still I am. It sure if they are able to understand my problem. Every time they give same explanation that my query has been forwarded to backend team and they are looking into it. I had asked for escalation matrix, but haven't received despite multiple requests. It's extremely disappointing."
55,escalation matrix,"CSE said she will speak with seniors & revert. No revert. At some point, a conversation is necessary because all issues are not covered in list provided in chat. And a clear escalation matrix would inspire more confidence."
55,escalation matrix,Have been raising issues of non crediting of points for my stay at Taj Exotica Goa over last 3 weeks. The issue is yet to be resolved. The Customer care is reluctant to put me on to the floor manager or give me escalation matrix. Further more email written on 26th Apr too has not been replied
56,Tata Neu,"Very bad service of Tata Neu 
No resolution "
56,Tata Neu,Sir I bought grocery from Big Basket thru Tata Neu on 28/07/22. Some item pack was vaccum leaked. 
56,Tata Neu,Very very worrest App Tata Neu and customer service 
56,Tata Neu,"The Big Basket application within Tata Neu  was a complete disappointment.  In the first try, I paid through NUE coins and cash. but the process aborted. I then had to pay cash all over again. I have now lost the NUE coin credit. 
when the delivery boy came he said he had double the order and he had brought them. I said I did not want it and he took them.away but I have not got the credit for the Neu coins."
56,Tata Neu,Simply she saying my voice is not clear.  I requested her see email sent to bigbasket and 1mg. Also informed to her when I received conformation email for update of mobile number why it is reverted.  There is no proper response simply saying my voice is not clear.  However I again sent email to Tata Neu Customer Care please see and do the needful.
56,Tata Neu,Pathetic Service from Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
56,Tata Neu,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
56,Tata Neu,Overall Tata Neu is good quality service to customers and resolving issues immediately by constantly following up the issues in resolving but in bigbasket restocking the items notifications not coming to registered email to customers whenever products going out of stock in bigbasket 
56,Tata Neu,"This is a serious gap in Tata Neu this help service as well the platform requires creative mind who can walk through different aspect of customer problems. At present ""it is I do not know or you have to check with another part in the platform'"
56,Tata Neu,"Cannot expect such slow poor and delayed service from a Tata enterprise. Even the Tata Neu application has a lot of snags 
 "
56,Tata Neu,I have quit Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,Extremely disappointing....Definitely my last through Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,"More than Customer care, it's the basic order processing & delivery issue, poor reflection of the status in your Tata Neu app. is the fundamental problem, Customer care can not handle the basic issues with order fulfillment & delivery."
56,Tata Neu,"I think, the customer care executive was really trying, but just saying I understand your problem, I am sorry for it a hundred times, doesn't help. They need to know how to solve the problems.I think the systems are not smooth as before. It took me a whole morning to order something through Tata Neu that would have taken me 5 -10  minutes max on any other platform"
56,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is a great app but it will become superapp when it runs superfast speed. I am telling that because the app does not run smoothly.  
In electronics section, sometimes it runs good not very good but sometimes not. Sometimes entrie app goes on slow mode. I have been feeling laggy experience on Tata Neu. To compete with e-commerce giant , Tata nue will have to be smooth, lag free. 

My review on invoice :- I have not found any option in ordered section of the app where I can download my invoice of my product. The invoice which I gave got from Tata Neu is not in any downloadable format eg:- PDF or word etc. So I hope, In the next update  
I can see invoice features and lag free experience.
    ""Tata Neu the app for every Indian.""

56,Tata Neu,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
56,Tata Neu,Thanks to all the customer care executives for prompt support each time. Heartily thanks to Grievance officer Tata Neu. Wishes all the very best to wonderful team of Croma. Keep it up. 
56,Tata Neu,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet

56,Tata Neu,I chased for my refund for more than 2 months and I gave up. I am no more interested in pursuing for my refund. Very very disappointed with Tata Neu.
56,Tata Neu,I keep facing issues with the Tata Neu App. It gets issues every time I use it 
56,Tata Neu,"Thank you for quick resolution of my issue. But I think integration between other tata apps and tata neu needs improvement. Sometimes big basket, tata play or 1mg doesn't open from Tata Neu though these work properly from individual apps. "

56,Tata Neu,I was not allowed to explain the issue clearly and 2-3 calls and emails from the customer support team explaining what they think the issue was and the best part was no resolution except saying try JustPay which i have no clue what is it...Anyways stopped using Tata Neu unless i am forced to and using other apps which are quite smooth...Listen to the customer first rather than trying to be oversmart...
56,Tata Neu,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily
56,Tata Neu,"Cromartie executive didn't know the details of Tata Neu app,how customers would benefit from the app."
56,Tata Neu,"Due to error in spelling of name ( your side) in my profile, could not book flight and lost out on Neucoins. This was my first attempt at using Tata Neu and hence discovered error now only. Had to book flights thru MMT"
56,Tata Neu,"Freecharge is accepted in Big basket, why not on Tata Neu? "
56,Tata Neu,"The worst shopping and customer care experience ever! Never shopping from Tata Neu again. Just to get an update on my order, it took more than 72 hours. Plus my order did not even get delivered. My refund has not been initiated. The customer care executive I spoke to first did not even understand the issue and says things like because a sale is ongoing on Westside products they couldn't handle my order. If an order cannot be handled by such a big brand it's better to shut it down for good. Never shopping from you and I am going to spread the word among my friends and family as well."
56,Tata Neu,worst service ever experienced with any Tata org... have to improve lot with Tata Neu else dont know where this land...ridiculous in one word
56,Tata Neu,"You have a pathetic platform where you want people to come and spend time placing the orders while the payments in your backend get stuck. I ended up placing 2 orders via Tata Neu where payment was deducted from my bank and order never got processed. The customer care executive hardly cared and told this is backend issue, please place a fresh order. Also, the 5%cashback which is promised on your platform does not seem to be a realty as you can check for yourselves based on the order from my account registered with the number 9916785363."
56,Tata Neu,Even to take back a defective product it took several days by your team and I was only receiving emails after emails but no action. Now there is no noise about refund of my money. Tata Neu is a colossal failure I believe and would strongly advise my acquaintances to avoid using it for online purchase and prefer Amazon and Flipkart for their outstanding services. 
56,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu has passed on the losses due to its portal glitch, over to me. This resulted in my Harrassment and TATANEU keeping my payment without delivering me the products. "
56,Tata Neu,"Software part of Tata Neu has many Glitches, to be addressed at earliest"
56,Tata Neu,Same repeated issues and customer care representative have no adequate knowledge about the issues and Tata Neu overall app. The App has lots of bugs and there is no efforts either to understand or solve the issues. Very pathetic app   
56,Tata Neu,"Pathetic pathetic pathetic pathetic service by Tata Neu. My order was delivered on Wednesday and till Saturday Installation has not happened. I need compensation of Rs 5,000 for delay in installation. I have not received installation SMS also till today. Whereas other online company as well as Croma is also providing installation of electronic product in 24 hours. "
56,Tata Neu,It is a good system for material supply from warehouse with minimum staff and without physical opening the stores whereby Tata Neu can offer larger discounts. But today after receiving my order I found that in some of the items MRP was charged vide order no. TN-1079755674-20221027. Please also add more varieties of tea and other things. 
56,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu app is slow in my phone. Otherwise, I just have positive feedback."
56,Tata Neu,Thank you so much Deepak & Tata Neu team 
56,Tata Neu,"As, of now. No
My concern was 250 NeuCoins.
As I discussed with excutive, I will be eligible if purchased thorough Tata Neu before 21st.
I hope I will earn."
56,Tata Neu,"Hi Tata Neu Team

Thanks Nikhil Asopa for addressing my concern and resolving it up to expectation. Thouth it was resolved, the process of getting support was not easy, many people were involved in communication which was quite time consuming and frustrating, resolution process might be quite simpler.

BR
Prakash"
56,Tata Neu,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address..!!?? Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good."
56,Tata Neu,Make Tata Neu app faster. It lags way too much to be usable.
56,Tata Neu,Useless. Never shop again on Tata Neu 
56,Tata Neu,Your Tata Neu is hopeless.They could not solve my problem .Finally Bigbasket daily executive advised to update the app through play store.I did it and problem is over.
56,Tata Neu,Improve Tata Neu payment method with tata pay upi.
56,Tata Neu,"I was given good amount of explanation on my query.  Although, I was not very satisfied after placing the order because I received a text message from Croma asking that the payment was not completed and they provided a new link for payment (also tata new app said product not processed until 1 day after purchase). I had purchased the product using Tata Neu App and no Cost EMI option. It is confusing for the customer and might end up paying twice for the product. After the call, I am assured that the product purchase is completed and it is in shipped status. Eagerly waiting for the product to get delivered. Thank You Team."
56,Tata Neu,"I am really sad to learn the pathetic service from Tata Neu whether its customer care executive or your delivery partner. If you cannot provide me the service than why the hell you take the order and money. You have my address and every other detail , and you should first ascertain the fact first. I need the mobile on very urgent basis but because of your poor and degraded service i am unable to get it now and more so my money is also blocked which i cant use to purchase from some where else. Thanks and regards. My only advise would be to improve your self  bcoz this sought of harassments would really affect the reputation of your brand Tata Neu"
56,Tata Neu,"I tried to explain to each agent that I had not cancelled the Croma Order after paying the total amount by Credit Card and that there was a fraud being committed at either Croma or in the NeuCoins department of Tata Neu, but nobody has taken it seriously. I have bee defrauded of 120 - 6 = 114 New Coins"
56,Tata Neu,I was struggling to get confirmation on my orders placed on Big Basket through the very slow Tata Neu App. My payments were debited & I did not get any invoice over email or app when I asked for it
56,Tata Neu,Purchases at Westside stores not getting integrated in Tata Neu. Call Centre has no visibility to this and ask for physical receipts.
56,Tata Neu,It took them over 2 weeks just to inform me that a Covid RT-PCR test through Tata 1mg app does not contribute towards Tata Neu Coins. Expect better from such a reputed company.
56,Tata Neu,"You guys are useless, issues spanned for more than 2 months and I still dont have refund. Never ordering from Tata Cliq or Tata Neu again in my life"
56,Tata Neu,I had placed my query on 18th June. Itâ€™s already 24th June now. They are still stalling my issue and not giving any resolve. Pathetic customer service and pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Worst platform to buy anything.
56,Tata Neu,"I was told to share the screenshot of the problem I had raised. Am email was supposed to be send by Tata Neu, in which I had to share the screenshot. However, I didn't receive any email or link."
56,Tata Neu,"However, the bills paid in the Taj Hotels bars after discounts during happy hours do not qualify for Tata Neu points. This must be rectified."
56,Tata Neu,"I had a worst experience with Tata Neu. First purchase and you lost me as a customer and I ever interact with anyone. I won't purchase a thing from here. Never going to suggest to purchase. Customer support not one multiple worthless. Knowledge less. They are supposed to know that discount price and no cost emi upfront waiver is from merchant itself not bank. Even after making them understand they routed me to bank. I'm waiting for a reply from Neu otherwise you soon be getting a legal notice from consumer court, filed by mem worst place to purchase. Never visting again"
56,Tata Neu,Unable to use NEU coins on big basket and now coins will expire without me availing benefit called both Big Basket and Tata Neu but issue not yet resolved
56,Tata Neu,"Problem Not resolved It. I am not able to make Payment. I also pay my electric Bill but this month onward , I have to go through other payment portal because of this problem. Being a Tata Steel Employee this is unfortunate for me. I am not able to use Tata Neu."
56,Tata Neu,"The issue was not all resolved, till date. Requesting the Tata Neu Team to kindly resolve the issue and refund the cancellation amount of Rs.262 to Credit card and 37 Neu Coins."
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu app is a good initiative & offers great benifits to customer. Moreover it is very user friendly.
56,Tata Neu,Wishing the entire Tata Neu team all the very best. May you beat Amazon (also Reliance- the unreliable) and rule India with the maximum market share. Best wishes from a Tata loyalist and shareholder!
56,Tata Neu,Sorry to say no one has called me nor have replied to my query. Contacting and communication was easy with Taj Inner Circle group earlier. Tata Neu app is horrible and cannot resolve or refer to specific questions .

56,Tata Neu,Bad that policies are changed and you could buy directly from BB and get Tata Neu points and now you must from directly Tata Neu app but is not informed that this change has happened.
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu and Tata Pay require lot of attention. Payment got stuck multiple time. APP gets hang in between
56,Tata Neu,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
56,Tata Neu,No proper response. Website not friendly. Tata Neu only wants to Apply for loans and not provide EMI Card.
56,Tata Neu,"Hi, This Is Vardhan Varma Penmetsa. I just Interact With Tata Neu Customer Care Service And The Person From Tata Neu Care End Was Responded Promptly And Sort Out My Issues. Thanks A Lot To Customer Care Executive Woo Responded Immediately And Solve The Issues And Wishing All Success To Team Tata Neu. Thank You So Much ? ?"
56,Tata Neu,"The Response is simply awesome, Thank You So Much And Wishing You All Success To Team Tata Neu.??"
56,Tata Neu,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
56,Tata Neu,Need to more quick respond in Tata Neu because its taking so much time.
56,Tata Neu,Really nice support is provided by Tata Neu support team.
56,Tata Neu,Dear Tata Neu welcome to new digital services We always with you We will remember your social services
56,Tata Neu,very bad experience...i am not getting my Tata Neu Coins... already raised complaint but no solution... only saying we are working on it.it had been 1 week...
56,Tata Neu,excellent. anyhow my problem is not resolved yet. My Tata 1mg cash could not be carried forwarded to Tata Neu Coin yet. Hope let me wait for some more days to to resolve this
56,Tata Neu,Worst experience with Tata Neu ordering. It took 1 hour on chat to make him understand the issue. It would have been better to talk instead of chat for an hour.
56,Tata Neu,"Grocery part is not accessible, app gets hanged in the case of clicking Grocery. For some other items also App gets hanged. Secondly I am having 2 Accounts of Tata 1 mg and I have been operating the one with Mobile No. 9981491770. (Email id daudchoudhary@gmail.com. I want this account be merged with Tata Neu App with Mobile No. 9424442773 (email id -daudchoudhary@yahoo.com), but somehow it is not getting done. Earlier also I requested to chnage my mobile no. From 9981491770 to 9424442773, but I was informed it is not possible. If it isnot possible, atleast transfer all my Orders and Prescriptions to the Account with Mobile No.9424442773, for records."
56,Tata Neu,"At least there should be a way to resolve the issue than letting the customer to figure out what should be done. The call as well as the email response was below expectations. My belief that Tata would be ae to take on Amazon lies in vain, I dont think from my experience. Even Flipkart fares below Amazon in meeting customer expectations. Tata Neu has failed to impress me, franky speaking."
56,Tata Neu,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu coins not received even after raising ticket twice. Please resolve Ticket #720576 asap.
56,Tata Neu,No solution with your representatives. Even they don't know about Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,I am not satisfied because I have made a big purchase only few weeks before launch of Tata Neu and I am not getting any Neu coins for that purchase. I am not likely to make such a big purchase again in the next 3-4 years so I feel I have missed out on the benefit of Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
56,Tata Neu,"1) Prepaid Recharge function not working properly. 2) Tata Pay options not found in the payment menu. Somehow this important feature is missed. 3) In Big Basket Tata Neu payment option is not working. When we choose initially Cash on Delivery. 4) Neu Points should accept the decimals. Otherwise, the bill value should get convert to next higher number for us to use Neucoins. 5) Overall introduced in a hurry, always asking for a screenshot and it is really frustrating. 6) Hope someone at the top level sees the comment and take corrective action."
56,Tata Neu,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
56,Tata Neu,I HAVE BEEN USING TATANEU FROM PAST 4 TO 5 MONTHS..Tata Neu is getting stuck/Hanged a lot ...it taking time to load ....please work on it .It is very beneficial app...but its affecting the enjoyment of surfing and shopping because of slowing and loading issues
56,Tata Neu,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
56,Tata Neu,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
56,Tata Neu,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
56,Tata Neu,"Though the App integrates all Tata Brands, operational integration to meet even the current standards (and hence customer expectation) is a long way. Case in point: Big Basket allows to order upto 10 pm ist and still deliver next day morning at 6 am. It does not happen when ordering the same on Tata Neu, though it says, rather claims its powered by Big Basket. If that was the case, I, as a customer, would have seen the same service levels. Will continue to experiment and hope that the current service levels are maintained at the very least."
56,Tata Neu,My Tata Neu coins are not credited still for F& B purchased 2 days back
56,Tata Neu,No response from anyone on the chat on Tata Neu App.
56,Tata Neu,"The support is good, problem is with the the service and product. Buying experience at both Tata Neu and Croma were underwhelming. Tata Neu fails to complete payment and Croma always succeeds to show products as available until you complete the payment."
56,Tata Neu,"Iam very upset with Tata Neu, i used to earn good number of coins while using BB app. Now it has suddenly stopped stating i need to buy through Tata Neu? was there any communication???????????????? i have placed 2 orders 1632/- and 1225/- where i was supposed to earn 10% extra neu coins. I received a message that 10% additional coins would be added to my account. Now i have received a message that it was wrongly stated i will not be getting the coins !!!!!!! is this a joke?"
56,Tata Neu,"I performed the necessary transaction on BigBasket via TataNeu app for 1200+ amount. And as per the listed promo on app, I expect 10% Tata Neu coins to be credited in my account, but I got ZERO for now. And worst there's no explanation for it."
56,Tata Neu,Even after purchasing in thousands from Croma the points didnâ€™t get credited to the Tata Neu points. Have been following up with the customer service for past few weeks but NO RESPONSE. Totally frustrated.
56,Tata Neu,Remove compulsion to complete transaction with Tata pay for redeeming Tata Neu coins in case of 1mg etc.
56,Tata Neu,"My refund is stuck for 15days and counting, since I returned it. This way Tata Neu is not going far."
56,Tata Neu,"u have come out with Tata Neu without fully constructing. Profile doesn't work at all. After filling every thing, it again ask to fill in yyyy/mm/dt format which is not possible. I am surprised a company of your repute can come out with such a thing. I am disapppointed"
56,Tata Neu,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
56,Tata Neu,Poor service by Tata Neu team.
56,Tata Neu,I have not interacted with any customer service representative of Tata Neu. Looks like some issue with your system.
56,Tata Neu,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
56,Tata Neu,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
56,Tata Neu,"still neither is my account or orders shown. Against ID rajivnor@gmail.com I had made many purchases... can't your people locate the same. My Tata Neu ID is rajivnor@gmail.com, Cliq ID is same, Cliq phone number was 9739800430, remap that phone with 9035027150 and transfer orders to neu. Also some credit points of 150 rs was there"
56,Tata Neu,"Online Order was placed on 12.04.2022on Tata Neu .Material delivered on 15.04.2022 however the date of delivery was upto 14.04.2022. Till date (20.04.2022) AC has not been installed and no communication regarding installation . Contacted customer service representative many times but they are not even able to tell me whether installation of AC shall be done by the representative of Croma or not. And if yes, then when it will be installed. Very P athletic conditions and against the brand name. On the site of croma(Tata Neu) the installation date was from 48-72 Hrs. Now , even I canâ€™t return the product."
56,Tata Neu,"The CS rep was not able to understand the issue. For everything, there were 2-3 minutes wait time. He was always coming back with the same information (which I already knew). At the end, I gave up and ended the chat. The issue is still unresolved - I was supposed to get New points worth 10% of my last order value (Rs. 1700), however, I ended up getting points worth only 5% that is 85 New points. Let's see of somebody cares to get back to me regarding my issue from Tata Neu."
56,Tata Neu,Concern still pending. No resolution provided. Unable to add my Tata Play account in Tata Neu.
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a misleading initiative. I purchased a product and it had multiple Order IDs.. for none I received the Neu Points.. Customer care can't help and it's useless to spend time with them.
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Customer Care Service always unable to understand customer problem...no resolution given yet...
56,Tata Neu,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
56,Tata Neu,Issue was not resolved. Just False assurances. The experience has been very painful. Regret ordering on Tata Neu App. Thanks to your poor service I have missed my interview for which I had ordered the product. Pathetic service and customer support. People lie blatantly without any knowledge of how to resolve the issue
56,Tata Neu,Very bad customer service and support. Tata Neu is Least bothered about serving the customer on time. I have been left to suffer. And worst is that Tata Neu is shamelessly inconsiderate about the inconvenience they have caused to me.
56,Tata Neu,Not have good experience with Tata Neu . Disappointing with Tata as never expected this kind of quality from Tata
56,Tata Neu,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
56,Tata Neu,"Still No response from Tata Neu. Have gone totally silent after giving FALSE assurances. No response to my email, my Twitter DMs.. NOTHING. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !"
56,Tata Neu,"I don't think I can recommend Tata Neu to anyone at this point. I just placed 2 orders through Tata Neu so far and I faced major technical issues. On top of it, your customer care executive mentioned that the servers are down since more than a day. This is very disappointing and left me with a bad experience using Tata Neu. I'm still unable to get the product I needed from Croma, even after multiple follow ups."
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Payment Service NOT WORKING Properly ....Debit Card Payment combined with NeuCoins FAILS invariably ......if payment made using Debit Card BUT NO NeuCoins included then Payment will go thru .......seems yours payment system doesn't like us to use NeuCoins ...
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu took money. Then cancelled order citing 'Technical Issues' 2 days after. Money not yet refunded. Pathetic experience
56,Tata Neu,I ll never recommend any one to shop with Tata Neu as they don't care complaint raised and leave the customer in lurch
56,Tata Neu,"The fact that Tata Neu only reached out to me after 4 chat message discussions with customer service reps and 1 call itself says a lot worse about Tata Neu CS. I also have an inkling to why this could be happening. When I first palced a replacement request no one listened..and when I asked for cancellation and refund it was immediately picked up within 12 hours. 1. You never had a replacement product. 2. You knew that this product was substandard (pack was June 2020. i,.e almost 2 yr old lying unsold in a godown in gujarat) and hence it was offered at an attractive price to clear it off. 3. Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works..Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service . Request to let it reach the head of CS. Tata Neu didnt live up to Neu. Nothing new in Neu."

56,Tata Neu,"No one contacted from Tata Neu, how can you ask to give feedback and highlight wrong statements that I had an interaction with an executive?"
56,Tata Neu,Very bad experience with Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.
56,Tata Neu,"Third Class CC service by TATA s , ths is india's No, third Class Service. Executive giving answer without knowing any thing about therir product. Not answering mail after many reminder. Solver half problem and creat another problem. you creaate mess after launching Tata Neu App. my issue is still there and you create another one."
56,Tata Neu,I am awaiting my refund for the cancellation of hotel booking at Taj palace Delhi through Tata Neu app. It is more than 10 days and I havenâ€™t yet received my refund
56,Tata Neu,Neu Coins aren't credited inspite of making payment through Tata Neu App. No resolution even after giving complaints on customer care over chat
56,Tata Neu,The request I raised is still open and I didn't get any call or message from Tata Neu on the same. Surprised to see that the feedback is being solicited without any communication on the request raised
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu and its affiliates have to really work hard on bring their return process to a level where you can really compete with the likes of Amazon. Your logistics partner Ekart is really bad when it comes to picking up a product. I placed two return requests on April 22 and they got picked yesterday. I wasted my whole weekend waiting for Ekart's executive to pick up my stuff and NO ONE turned up. This is highly disappointing. To top it off the customer service executive very calmly said it normally takes 3 working days to pick a product from data of initiation. Disappointed to the max.
56,Tata Neu,No one called or contacted me. Sad Tata Neu is tooo bad. Poorest ever service seen in my life.
56,Tata Neu,"I ll not recommend any of my near and dear to use Tata Neu as they dont have control on their Brands to resolve a issue. If customer raises an issue with Tata Neu , they can only do is raise a complaint with the concerned brand .Until unless the Brand doesnot respond , customer will not get an update and he/she will die waiting for a resolution. Pathetic service and No one cares customers as Both Tata Neu & Brands doesnot reply to emails sent,chat doesnot work lately,cannot connect to customer care due to premium numberrs of other Brands. Better i suggest not to place orders as the pain you undergo is unimaginable."
56,Tata Neu,"I never ever trust Tata Neu after my first order which i had is so sour to digest .Not even having empathy to call customer with a resolution. Only says, complaint has been escalated and will resolve.Bt its been 6 days without any update.So,how and why should i order from Tata Neu and its Brands.Just washing hands without providing a solution and ditching me in between.completely devasted with Tata Neu.."
56,Tata Neu,"I have product delivered, but installation taking 5 day's. There is no meanings you are sending product and installation after that in 5 business days. None of customer can wait for 5 day's. You need to improve your installation policy then only customer will get satisfied and will recomend the Tata Neu."
56,Tata Neu,pathetic experience with Tata Neu. i have been Big Basket for almost 6-7 months. i have never had any issues with them previously and was very happy with the service & delivery was always on time. This is the first time i ordered thru Tata Neu & was greatly disappointed & eventually had to cancel my order. i will not recommend Tata Neu to anyone
56,Tata Neu,I bought Airconditioner on Tata Neu and installation was delayed and resolution came so late.
56,Tata Neu,The way you guys are treating the IPL Tata Neu Fan Box is terrible. Would like yo talk to some senior level executive
56,Tata Neu,I had stayed in Taj Bangalore on 21 Jan 2022 and I do not see any points being added in Tata Neu. I was asked to get in touch again after 24 hours where as I had approached the rep after 4 days.
56,Tata Neu,"Even though promotion emails are disabled in the Tata Neu app, I still get promotional emails"
56,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is poorest service as I have seen. No refund amount credited after 9 days of refund initiation. When you don't know how to manage services then why you start new services. Poorest service of Croma, Tata cliq, etc."
56,Tata Neu,"Worst shopping experience I have ever had. The customer service personnel are unable to resolve the issues. 10 days after making a successful transaction, there was no order ID. Tata Neu customer service people asked me to call Croma and Croma personnel said there is no such order ID. I asked customer service personnel to escalate the issue and asked for a new order to be placed as the transaction was successful, but they said it was beyond their purview. Pathetic and most harrowing experience. You guys need to go a long long way to be in competition with such careless customer service. God bless you. I am disappointed to see my favourite brand go this way. ??"
56,Tata Neu,Never go with Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."

56,Tata Neu,"Customer support team is not knowledgeable on the Tata Neu, perhaps because this is too New(u) for them too."
56,Tata Neu,I don't remember anyone from Tata Neu calling me........
56,Tata Neu,My issue is still not solved and I havenâ€™t still got any reply on the status of my request. Purely worst experience. My issue is regarding Tata Neu coins which still have not been added to my account even after 2 weeks of my purchase from Croma store.
56,Tata Neu,"The customer care executive could not understand the issue with the payment by Tata Neu points and could not solve the same. Finally, had to pay with UPI."
56,Tata Neu,"I Buyed a product from Croma store, So just wanted to know about mine Tata Neu points but didn't got any response"
56,Tata Neu,I have not got the refund as 10 days are passed from refund initiation and after 8 days again I got mesaage of refund initiation which vulgar experience. Totally bad Tata Services. I don't recommend anyone a bit percent. Go to hell. If my refund will be provided as usual then I might be use again tata unistores and Tata Neu.
56,Tata Neu,My issue has not been resolved and Big basket only seeks an apology and doesn't even care to provide compensation due to their error making us starve for a night..I need this to be looked into as i am noway to listen as i trusted Tata Neu and placed the order and not Big basket..
56,Tata Neu,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu points were not credited. Had to manually tell them all the order IDs. I wonder if Tata Neu has any information systems. Had to chase customer care team for quite a few days for this. Concern still unresolved.
56,Tata Neu,Pathetic customer support. Ticket closed without providing any resolution. No solution updated or communicated to me. Problem still exists. I've been following up for 3 days now. Your team lacks empathy and your backend system is also not helping. I will never use Tata Neu again and make sure none of my friends use it by telling them truth about poor quality of support you guys provide.
56,Tata Neu,"My issue stands unresolved. Neu has taken away one Mother Dairy Curd ordered on 28th April. Since then, I have spoken to Tata Neu and Bigbasket help line. Both were groping in the dark. Surprised to note that the good experience at the start turned out to be a nightmare. Issue is not the Curd or Rs. 47.25; it's the lack of coordination and problem solving. The delivery boy said that the item was spoilt/ bad. So refund would be initiated. Wonder! How the new app can be botched up by some, so soon. Not in conformity with Tata experience!!!!"
56,Tata Neu,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
56,Tata Neu,"TATA Neu needs to expand the products availability. There are many products which are available on Amazon, Flipkart or even Jio but not on Tata Neu. I understand it will take a while to reach that stage but felt worth to share the feedback."
56,Tata Neu,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
56,Tata Neu,"Hi Team, I am raising the issue since 21st Apr 2022 and today is 03rd May 2022 .As of today the issue has not been resolved either by Tata Neu or your branch Big Basket where i placed the order. Its the responsibility of Tata Neu to be responsible to resolve this issue . Thanks & regards, sanjana reddy"
56,Tata Neu,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
56,Tata Neu,Bought through Tata Neu at bigbasket on promo stated that 10% neu coins would be awarded if purchase over 1200. Coins did not get credited for 72 hours post which grievance raised - neu got back stating 5% crecited in neu account and balance 5% if not credited one should get in touch with bigbasket??? How does bigbasket have ability to credit neu coins for a tata neu customer??? Why should tata neu holder chase bugbasket for 5% credit???
56,Tata Neu,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
56,Tata Neu,As Tata Neu is new therefore a lot of problems are coming in profile transferred to new profile from earlier profile on 1mg. mainly transfer of 1 mg cash to Tata Neu coins. Need to resolved quickly.
56,Tata Neu,Very poor service of Tata Neu Customer Care. Just 1 example 2 days ago I informed Customer Care that Mother Dairy Curd delivered was 4 days old when compared with the curd available on the Mother Dairy Vendors. Why Tata Neu can't deliver fresh products??? Even most of the groceries being delivered are minimum 1 month old. The above clearly shows that not only customer care but the complete team of Tata responsible for purchase of products and inventory Management is useless. Very Very Poor Show!
56,Tata Neu,Shitty service. I hasn't and wouldn't recommend Tata Neu to anyone.
56,Tata Neu,My order was supposed to be delivered by 2/may/2022. I still have not received it despite on continuous followups with customer care. I was promised by croma team my order would be delivered by 3/May/2022 and nothing happened. I received call today from Bluedart couriers and they said order will be delivered today (5/may/2022) and it still is not delivered. I was not being informed about delay in my order which is highly unsatisfactory. Had to multiple follow ups to get above info. Customer care representative was not able to provide me â€œgrievance email idâ€. Overall experience has been very bad and i wont be ordering anything from Tata Neu in future. In the age where you get groceries delivered in hours a Big brand like Tata is not able to deliver my order is simply unacceptable.
56,Tata Neu,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
56,Tata Neu,"twice i was told, I am eligible and will get cashback in 72 hrs or max 5 days. After 5 days I was told I was not eligible as per T&C. But those T&C are no where written and available to end customer. Clicking on BigBasket banner on Tata Neu did not show any terms and conditions but just took me to Big Basket. That's not fair!!!"
56,Tata Neu,"My e mail is patra_tbk@yahoo.com in AirAsia,where as in Tataneu my e mail is patra.tbk@gmail.com which needs to be corrected as patra_tbk@yahoo.com. As I booked air tickets through TATANEU-Air Asia,the benefits should be credited not withstanding variation in e mail address in AirAsia and Tata Neu."
56,Tata Neu,"1. Cashback offers that are available on Croma are not available on Tata Neu linked Croma 2. No option to purchase from another Croma account from single Tata Neu account 3. If someone wishes to avail offer twice, it is not possible"
56,Tata Neu,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish.

56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu platform is not able to deliver my booked item. It doesn't refund my money. Very poor service.
56,Tata Neu,"Hi Tata Neu,You never resolved the issue and Never your Brand Big Basket cares customers who trust a Brand like Tata..Tata Neu is responsible for my issue and it is not caring to contact it's own brand with a resolution rather than dragging issue since 18days causing distress ."
56,Tata Neu,I have been using big basket and 1mg for a long time and have bb star and diabetic care plans. Since the very start the Tata Neu is very buggy platform. Initially the payments didnâ€™t go through and I was forced to complete payment at bigbasket app. Now for several days I have been facing several issues like coins not credited to account and the resolution time is very long. Secondly the customer service is clueless they just do not understand the issue even after mailing proper order no. and transaction no. Still they are unable to resolve the issue.
56,Tata Neu,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
56,Tata Neu,"Still havenâ€™t been told as to by when I will receive the product. Every time I am told that a customer care representative will call, but havenâ€™t received any call. Tata Neu has taken almost INR 10000 for a luxury product and not delivered it on time or even given a date for delivery."
56,Tata Neu,"Very Bad service from Croma, Tata Capital,Tata Neu. In 14-20 Days Not got the refund."
56,Tata Neu,Got the prompt solution. Good work Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,Order item is not delivered even after 4 days of scheduled arrival date. No body at Tata Neu and Croma is able to solve
56,Tata Neu,My surname is incorrect in the Profile of Tata Neu App...I have asked to correct it...but it is not yet corrected.
56,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu is bouquet of Tata services under 1 platfoorm. It would've been better if Tata management understand what are existing issues in existing services before actually creating this bouquet. I placed order for refrigerator which was showing next day delivery. As it didn't delivered i cancelled order next day 11pm. 2-3 call center representatives confirmed my cancelation, still despatched refrigerator after 7 days. I didn't except the order, still it was marked delivered. Now my money got stucked as the product is showing delivered. Now i have to convince your team that i have not received the product and money should be refunded. Now this will tell you there are issues in so many levels in Croma service."
56,Tata Neu,Arrogant customer care agent. Very indifferent. Plus rigid policies. Basic things which must be done through app generally need calls etc and is a waste of time. Very unfriendly UI. Cannot recommend Tata Neu to anyone in this current form. I trusted Tata brand and tried but very disappointed.
56,Tata Neu,Issue was that neu coins not awarded for Air Asia as middle name was not updated in Tata Neu profile. I find this very rigid and inflexible. And ways to find excuse to not give neu coins.
56,Tata Neu,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
56,Tata Neu,I am very happy with my experience with Tata Neu so far.
56,Tata Neu,"Superb, Awesome, Tremendous, Excellent Services i have received from Tata Neu Team."
56,Tata Neu,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
56,Tata Neu,Very Bad service from Croma Tata Capital Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,"Even after raising my issue almost 8 days back, no update from Tata Neu team on my concern. Customer service executives are clueless."
56,Tata Neu,"Provide Tata Neu coins for online payment methods like scan,rechsrge"
56,Tata Neu,"I was getting emails from Tata Neu with creating any account but the agent is asking to create an account and turn off the notifications in setting, after account is created. Worst Resolution received."
56,Tata Neu,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
56,Tata Neu,No common sense is resolving issues. No knowledge of the Tata Neu App
56,Tata Neu,Very bad apps my order is 01/05/2022 . My account to pay.2834.10. my order decline my payment is not refund in 14 day very bad Tata NeuCroma team
56,Tata Neu,"I had purchased on Split Ac on 03.05.2022 in Tata Neu Portal. As per the offer, the standard installation is Rs. 499/- plus GST. I have the screen shut with me. But your installation agency demanded Rs. 1500/- plus GST which I have raised through written complain and through the Custmer Care. Custmet Care complaint no. is 970081. Even though the AC has been delivered on 08.05.2022 still it is not installed."
56,Tata Neu,Hopeless Tata Neu should close immediately
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a cheater and fraudster team who dont care issues raised.Just throw paltry amount and wash your hands is the attitude and way of business
56,Tata Neu,Product is good but Tata Neu / Croma need to take ownership for the delivery date which they promise... Promising next day delivery and delivering after 3 days Customer care guys dont have much to do except telling what is already known to customer
56,Tata Neu,My matter is yet to be resolved. And still no communication from Tata Neu. Thanks for service
56,Tata Neu,"CC Exe are all dumb. That can't understand a simple equation. The girl and the boy kept on talking about cashback, which was not the issue at all. The issue is about 2 Digital Gift Cards which I used online & afterwards I cancelled the order. The GC balance is now showing Zero . This has be be refilled/recharged ., or refunded to Wallet of Croma/Tata Neu if has any. The amount is 5000 & 500 Rs respectively. GC No 1001340042219485. & 1001340048367920. Education UR call center agents."
56,Tata Neu,Worst app and worst service I had done booking in taj hotel through it but donâ€™t get any Tata Neu points.worst experience
56,Tata Neu,The whole team at Tata Neu has no understanding of the amalgamation of all the Tata brands into one format and app .
56,Tata Neu,"We had Ordered Stevia powder on Tata Neu. When we receive the parcel, out of the two jars one jar was broken open and the powder was all over the envelope, which I checked only upon my return to the city, on ninth May. However, that seems to be out of the return period and the customer care executives are still unable to help us in this matter."
56,Tata Neu,"My issue was not resolved. Even after putting order through Tata Neu App, i was told that order was through Bigbasket. I have downloaded BB but haven't done any transaction."
56,Tata Neu,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
56,Tata Neu,My simple concern was to Change my Name as it was incorrect and taken automatically by the app. I have no idea how an application takes false name automatically. It was very simple query that can be addressed easily by the huge firm like Tata. But I had to delete all my tata accounts for this issue. How bad can an application be. Pathetic experience. Poor support and bad experience with Tata Neu.
56,Tata Neu,"Forget friends, will not recommend Tata Neu to enemies also. Worst customer care."
56,Tata Neu,"It's my first order with tata i had thought it might good because it's brand it's totally fail & the worst experience i had ever face on E-commerce site, i had order which neither place or not properly file as complain till email. I had contacted to customer care they wasted my 1 to 2 Day's in chat only not file the complaint after that i had find somewhere to wrote email then it get resolve if i have stay depended on tata customer service i might never get my money retune... First think first customer is the priority who trust & spend online money if we didn't get the proper response it's the trust loss easily what i had face with tata i pray no one will face in future because it's hard to earn money & difficult u to understand how it matter when someone continues contact but no result come only the new chat & new customer care person contact..... Well thanks for retune I'll be never do the shopping from Tata Neu again because due to this only i had lost the other offers thanks..."
56,Tata Neu,Thank you so much Tata Neu good process and good service thank you so much Tata team. ??â¤ï¸
56,Tata Neu,"I haven't been able to login in Tata Neu App after download, I have emailed error screenshot to customercare@tataneu.com but no reply or assistance received till now."
56,Tata Neu,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
56,Tata Neu,"I have applied for a PL through Tata Neu Qik Loan for INR 1,90,000 for 36 months, on 12th May. The digital KYC system was down and I opted for physical KYC collection. No one has come to collect those documents, nor called me. I raised a ticket, numbered, 1017592, last week. I have been following up with customer service, but all I am getting are empty promises to solve this issue within 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Nothing has happened so far! Please solve this issue. I need the funds at the earliest. My son has surgery on 10th June."
56,Tata Neu,Pathetic & Horrible shopping experience with Tata Neu App
56,Tata Neu,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
56,Tata Neu,I bought from Tata Neu because I love the Tata brand but this time Croma failed to prove its services and customer service. Bad customer service.
56,Tata Neu,Very poor response from Tata Neu. No solution has been provided after multiple followup.
56,Tata Neu,My Tata Neu points got deducted yet I had to pay cash on delivery
56,Tata Neu,"I would like to inform you that I was assured that I would receive 5% nue points on my purchasing through Tata neu app. I called in month of April 2022 on customer care no of Tata Neu App (before my purchase) and was Informed regarding the same i.e. 5% neu points. But till date I have received the 5% neu points of my purchasing. Moreover, I had a talk on 13th May 2022 with Mr. Mehul and Ms. Bhawan( Supervisiors), they also assured me that I will get the points in my account ( mobile no 880067866) but till date I havenâ€™t received the 5% nue points . Kindly do the needful ."
56,Tata Neu,I've not received my Tata Neu coins for aarch transaction till now!
56,Tata Neu,"Never will recommend Tata Neu. Will not make that mistake. Its been more than 3 weeks, i havent got my Tata neu coins so far. It has been a pathetic experience with Tata Neu. Made a big mistake booking Gateway Chikmaglur through Tata Neu. Didnt get the best price and also, was not aware the price didnt include food. It didnt even cover breakfast. Tata Neu booking hid this fact from me and didnt show the price with food included. Ended up paying a huge amount for 2 days stay. And to top it, didnt even get Tata Neu coins for it."
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu is a terrible app. And the customer service is pathetic!
56,Tata Neu,No solution despite repeated follow ups with CS on purchases made through Tata Neu/ Big Basket & Croma. Too many bugs in the system.
56,Tata Neu,Not providing good service. Flipkart and Amazon much better than Tata Neu. Will not recommend to others.
56,Tata Neu,"My order is still not delivered. Money is deducted but no response on my order delivery from Tata Neu. Being an employee of Croma , This is my worst every shopping experience. If anyone is reading this, Please call me on 9819777107 to resolve my query"
56,Tata Neu,You guys are still havenâ€™t teething issues with fluency of app. Hope to see that everything will be good in coming days. All the best. I am happy to see Tata Neu finally here.
56,Tata Neu,"my Tata Neu points dispute not yet resolved, even after so many follow up on mail and phone."
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Coins not credited even after repeated mails & complaints over calls
56,Tata Neu,Worst experience. Never face in any e commerce site.Shame on Tata Neu
56,Tata Neu,"Tata Neu / BB have been sending messages on Neu Coins/ Neu membership etc. Incessantly. I have disabled all notifications on the app at my end, yet they continue. Please differentiate between service messages, like delivery status and promotional messages. Its very bugging to be spammed by such a respected brand"
56,Tata Neu,Ticket resolution time longer than any other e-commerce websites. How will Tata Neu compete with those!!!
56,Tata Neu,"It is a great initiative. Just need to fix some bugs and app speed issue. At support end, need to train for better response rather than just saying uninstall and install the app. Rest, I am very proud of Tata Neu App - Desh ka App,"
56,Tata Neu,A bunch of crooks and stealers. There is no way Tata Neu can survive infront of Amazon and Flipkart
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu App need a lot of improvement. Payment does NOT work well. Resolve all issues ASAP.
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu Customer Service Sucks. The agentâ€™s don't have the information about the offers and about the app.
56,Tata Neu,This was my first purchase from Tata Neu as I was looking for an alternative to Amazon/ Flipkart. But I am very disappointed with the service. I never had such experience while doing any shopping on Amazon/ Flipkart in last 10-12 years. Now i will have no choice but to go back to Amazon/ Flipkart only. Thanks for the great experience.
56,Tata Neu,Tata Neu app is dead slow
56,Tata Neu,Ever since Tata Neu was introduced overall experience with all your Apps are bad. Did not expect such a half boiled App from TATA!
56,Tata Neu,"I have been waiting for response on my Tata Neu Points and its not answerable from last one month. All are saying same thing, system is being updated."
56,Tata Neu,Really very nice service provided by the customer care team. Ms Preeti has attended me very well and resolved all my doubts in very poliote manner. What i expect from Tata is the same. Maintain this. Thanks Tata Neu Team.
56,Tata Neu,"Very bad service. I had applied for a Personal Loan on 21st. April. All my paperwork are done. Even the e-mandate procedure was done and Tata Neu took 118/- from my Account, but it's been about 40 days gone. Still the LOAN amount of 1 Lakh is not disbursed ."
57,Bigbasket,"On Bigbasket order TataNeu gives 5% Neucoins on every order, but I have not received any NeuCoins on my Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022, please provide NeuCoins on Bigbasket order of 7th August 2022 - Mrs. Patva "
57,Bigbasket,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
57,Bigbasket,"Pl refund the payment made at icici.upi from my account for Bigbasket (Bangalore) order dated 23/9/22 
Not Received refund till date and time in my account
Kindly expedite as order and deduction payment is dated 22/9/22 and 23/9/22 respectively 
"
57,Bigbasket,Your newly designed website is not user-friendly at all. Plus many earlier features of individual sites like Bigbasket are missing now. 
57,Bigbasket,Your Tata Neu is hopeless.They could not solve my problem .Finally Bigbasket daily executive advised to update the app through play store.I did it and problem is over.
57,Bigbasket,"Please can you extend the order placement time of express delivery upto 10 pm.. It is upto 8 pm now. 
Kindly like to know that why no express delivery option in my tataneu app?.. It is available only in my Bigbasket app. "
57,Bigbasket,Issue remains unresolved. Malpractice related to product pricing was highlighted on Bigbasket products and I am yet to hear on the issue.

57,Bigbasket,This boy tried helping me a lot. But this app seems to be problematic. Please improve ur app specially Bigbasket. Customer service is very good
57,Bigbasket,My Bigbasket account deactivated without any proper reason.
57,Bigbasket,"I understand the product will involve as time goes and I don't have any concern with the UI or how smoothly the app integrates with other apps owned by Tata but while doing payments through the app, the payment page kept loading and nothing happened. I spent at least an hour to complete my payment and still unable to do so even after taking help from customer service. Finally, I completed my payment through Bigbasket app. I really don't understand, how hard it is for a product to pull payment details from the gateway. I was so disappointed."
57,Bigbasket,"Since the launch of the app. I have not been able to purchase anything from any of the Tata's brand like Bigbasket, TataCliq, IHCL. I have already raised an issue with the customer care team and asked me to wait for 72 hours but still hasn't been solved. I have been Tata's customer for around 20 years and there have been very few occasion where I have been let down by the team. I really hope that they get to the bottom of this and solve this issue asap."
57,Bigbasket,I placed groceries order on Bigbasket through Tata NEU but my NEU COINS are not getting reflected there in my TATA NEU account.
57,Bigbasket,I had a query on the offer on Big basket for which I received an email which said that you get 10% tata neu coins when you shop at Bigbasket using the Tata neu app. However I received only 5%. On reaching the customer care she was not clear on the offer. She mentioned that I would not get any coins as I paid using existing neu coins which I feel is incorrect.
57,Bigbasket,Neu Rewards bugs no rewards till now for Bigbasket orders
57,Bigbasket,"I was suppose to get 10% points on Bigbasket transaction, with 2 chats , executive also confirmed same, but still not received 10% , received only 5 %."
57,Bigbasket,"Please change the look of your App, very pathetic and not user friendly. Please remove the black colour, it is not at all appealing good, and creates more strain to the eyes. Never expected this kinf of App from Tata. Bigbasket app is very good and I will say one of the best App."
57,Bigbasket,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
57,Bigbasket,"My issue stands unresolved. Neu has taken away one Mother Dairy Curd ordered on 28th April. Since then, I have spoken to Tata Neu and Bigbasket help line. Both were groping in the dark. Surprised to note that the good experience at the start turned out to be a nightmare. Issue is not the Curd or Rs. 47.25; it's the lack of coordination and problem solving. The delivery boy said that the item was spoilt/ bad. So refund would be initiated. Wonder! How the new app can be botched up by some, so soon. Not in conformity with Tata experience!!!!"
57,Bigbasket,"I cancelled the order i placed in BigBasket. Think had been a customer for years with Bigbasket, coming of TataNeu will end this i think. There is no UPI payment facility. The customer service says it is there. I quit."
57,Bigbasket,Yet to receive Neucoins for my previous orders on Bigbasket
57,Bigbasket,I have some issues from Bigbasket because I order any vegetables perticular price but few hour later my order modify and price is increase.
57,Bigbasket,My problem remains. Further If I go Bigbasket thru your neu app it says we are not serving your area but thru Bigbasket I am placing order from many years.
57,Bigbasket,"Wherever TATA takes over be it Tatacliq, TATA power, 1mg, PharmEasy or even Bigbasket, everywhere customer care service is reaching its Lowest levels. Thumbs down ?? for TATA services. I hope it's not the worst service with Tata airlines"
57,Bigbasket,The representative was helpful but the Issue is still un-resolved as Bigbasket Team hasn't replied my mail and delivery of the ordered Item is still pending.
57,Bigbasket,"My issue was not resolved. Even after putting order through Tata Neu App, i was told that order was through Bigbasket. I have downloaded BB but haven't done any transaction."

58,Tata Neu app,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
58,Tata Neu app,"Cannot expect such slow poor and delayed service from a Tata enterprise. Even the Tata Neu application has a lot of snags 
 "
58,Tata Neu app,"More than Customer care, it's the basic order processing & delivery issue, poor reflection of the status in your Tata Neu app. is the fundamental problem, Customer care can not handle the basic issues with order fulfillment & delivery."
58,Tata Neu app,"Customer care did not try to understand the actual issue and not even resolved it. The problem was that even after doing the complete process of ordering from Tata Neu app, orders show under Bigbasket, not Tata Neu as they ought to be."
58,Tata Neu app,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.

58,Tata Neu app,Sodexo meal pass option for payment is not available in Tata Neu app. This is strange since Big Basket app accepts sodexo meal.pass but not Neu. Please at least prominently display in Tata Neu app that you do not accept sodexo meal pass so that customers know easily

I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey.vikas3@tcs.com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure? What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch? What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

(Ticket Id#438417) Dear TataDigital Team, When I tried to register on the Tata Neu app it said ""hey you are already registered"" then I called up the help line to know that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com has been registered by ""Mayank Hooda"". My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4. Why it for the golden copy that my other accounts of Big Basket (exiting) connected by my mobile number changed to corporate ID Thank you & Regards, Vikas Pandey From: TataNeu Sent: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 7:15 PM To: VIKAS PANDEY Subject: Help us serve you better.

58,Tata Neu app,"The representative explained it well, but not sure why offer on croma.com is not available from Tata Neu app"
58,Tata Neu app,Bad that policies are changed and you could buy directly from BB and get Tata Neu points and now you must from directly Tata Neu app but is not informed that this change has happened.
58,Tata Neu app,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
58,Tata Neu app,"User experience of Big basket is not good through Tata Neu app. That's why I used purchase directly through BB app and Tata Neu app provided NEU coins after product delivered. Looks like April onwards policy has changed or technical glitches not sure , Tata neu has stoped providing the neu coins and no notification for these changes. Also difficult to chat in Tata neu app and cannot see what I typed in second line before submit"
58,Tata Neu app,"They don't know most of the process, they keep pointing fingers at each other. I did my booking using Tata Neu app, but they ask me to check with Airline. Airline in turn points me to Tata Neu!"
58,Tata Neu app,Have provided the feedback on Tata Neu App navigation with the team for better user experience. Still need more improvements on the user experience on Tata Neu app
58,Tata Neu app,I bought a laptop they payment was approved by Tata Neu app said transaction failed. I chatted with customer care and shared screenshot of transaction and then he confirmed that there is a technical issue on the side of Tata Neu.
58,Tata Neu app,I happy to use Tata Neu app. Because Tata Neu Services and customer support Team is Very Good and Apart from me I have also taught 2 people to use Tata Neu App.
58,Tata Neu app,"I placed an order on the Tata Neu app, payment got debuted but the orders is not showing confirmed nor have I received delivery of the same"
58,Tata Neu app,"I really want to use everything made in India where I can. However the experience was very very bad. With the delivery partner reaching the wrong address, calling me to tell that the order has been cancelled. To then reaching the chat on Tata Neu app (which by the way is very buggy right now.) to receive confusing updates. I have messages saying that the order will be delivered on 18th April while the Neu App. showing that the order stands cancelled. Don't know what to accept."
58,Tata Neu app,The store representatives are not aware of the Tata Neu app. They have to be trained
58,Tata Neu app,"I have placed order no. TN-1008781064-20220415 on bigbasket through Tata Neu app. The order was supposed to be delivered on 17 April between 1 pm and 3 pm, but has not been delivered till date despite three follow ups with the customer care helpline."
58,Tata Neu app,"I received only FALSE assurances and nothing more. The timelines have kept on increasing. Although assured that i will get a proactive update, it turned out to be a lie as nobody bothered to call me and update. It has been a miserable experience. Regret ordering on Tata Neu app."
58,Tata Neu app,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
58,Tata Neu app,Independent Apps were working much better and orders were much traceable then integrated app. Much difference between committed and actual delivery time. Will going to spread negative feedback for Tata Neu app.
58,Tata Neu app,I am awaiting my refund for the cancellation of hotel booking at Taj palace Delhi through Tata Neu app. It is more than 10 days and I havenâ€™t yet received my refund
58,Tata Neu app,"Even though promotion emails are disabled in the Tata Neu app, I still get promotional emails"
58,Tata Neu app,"The reason I used this Tata Neu app was Tata's loyalty. Slow application was not a problem for me which may have happened in the beginning. But its service is utter rubbish. They do not take any responsibility for any mistake. After the pending recharge transaction, I am told that if this recharge is not successful for 24 hours, then you should do another recharge, this one will be refunded to you. After remaining pending for 4 days, it is told that the recharge transaction has been successful from our side today. Which doesn't happen. Even after 12 days of customer calls and emails, the money was not refunded to me. While I also sent screenshots of transaction failure. I have uninstalled this nonsense service Tata Neu app."

58,Tata Neu app,"My issue is not with Customer service executive. This is issue with Tata Neu -> Bigbasket. For the 1st order of 15th Apr, order was broken by bigbasket into two & less Neu coins were credited. Bigger issue is, for the order of 28 apr, even though i ordered from Tata Neu app, I am being told that I ordered from Bigbasket so only 5% Neu coin were credited & not 10%. This is not like Tata brand, pls resolve the issue quickly & properly."
58,Tata Neu app,"My croma TV set warranty issue is still not solved & is under debate ! Some of your customer care representatives agreed what I say and some of them are giving vague answers! I think they are not trained properly! I don't have any clue about who will listen ,understand& solve my issue. Plus your croma customer care number is not a toll free number! It's chargeable !!! This is ridiculous & is not customer friendly behavior from your end. Tata Neu app is very much confusing in terms of the product warranty,extended warranty, after sales service ,time consuming for demo / installation of my TV set . Hence I won't recommend Tata Neu to friends n colleagues! I hope someone will call & discuss these issue with me ASAP. You can consider this as my complaint, suggestion, objection, feedback etc ! Thanks"
58,Tata Neu app,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
58,Tata Neu app,The status on delivery should be updated on the Tata Neu app.
58,Tata Neu app,"I did not get any benefit from using Tata Neu I have done a transaction using Tata Neu, because they claim it will be regarding in every transaction with 5% Neu Cash. But i did not received anything. I will try to minimize the use of Tata Neu app as it does not give benefit like other apps."
58,Tata Neu app,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."

58,Tata Neu app,"The Tata Neu app is poorly integrated with other apps through which services are provided. So, customer service executives have no information about any issues with the order. They have exactly the same amount of information that the customer has through the app. So, i called 4 times, but received 0 help. Only when I called croma directly was my issue resolved. Very Bad customer experience"
58,Tata Neu app,"The customer service team I interacted with over e-mail was very approachable and prompt in addressing my problem. However I am very disappointed with the Tata Neu app. If an item I am looking for is not available, the app just freezes and no option to exit is provided."
58,Tata Neu app,I missed out on the offer due to issue with Tata Neu app. Not happy with the issue resolution
58,Tata Neu app,"It was a simple requirement which should be resolved easily within Tata Neu app. But no, i have to go to bigbasket app and do it."
58,Tata Neu app,My Tata Play account is having a different mobile number and hence is not showing up in Tata Neu app. What to do?
58,Tata Neu app,"App is dead slow with your neu N graphics and eats up cache and memory! not able to upload the screenshot of tataneu order screen app crashed 8 times during upload. Basically this should be accessible by the agent instead of asking it from customer. Emailed the image in parallel but support agent not have access to email as email and chat support are not integrated ! poor process, system, beta app with lots of memory issues! problem status not updated till now, no email or sms from Tata Neu app after order is placed but it just directs to Bigbasket app or 1mg app just act like a messenger in between poorly managed ."
58,Tata Neu app,"Horrible, will never recommend Tata Neu app"
58,Tata Neu app,Tata Neu app is dead slow
59,order pending screen,The order pending screen is not user friendly.  To know the order status the screen is asking sub groups like electronics etc.  which is confusing.  It should directly display the pending items without the need of selecting any group.
60,Croma,No one understand my problem/query. No one took efforts to resolve it. First the employee in Croma Chandigarh have no knowledge. They are not conform me about how i get neu coins. All employees are full  lack of knowledge/ schemes
60,Croma,"The instore service executives at Croma Ghatkopar need to inform the customer regarding the difference in benefits of ordering through Tata Neu app prior to the purchase. even after informing the person that I use tata neu app, they did not tell me that there will be a difference in the neu points, nor did correctly update the invoice so that I can get the neupoints. I had to personally follow up and go through the process and hastle."
60,Croma,"I really had terrible experience, as the pick up store was changed without informing, plus when I visited another store the stock did not last, while it showed ready to pick up in my app and above it no one cancelled the order as promised by Croma employee.

Above it my payment is not  processed though its 15th day, and that too, I had to make a complaint for refund; should it have been suo moto, I would be more happy as this created a negative impression in my mind about Neu that in future if there is issue with order, my funds are not safe, as refunds are not done on time neither Neu team cares about informing status to customer on itself, it is the customer who has to go and beg for his refund.

I would never prefer croma or neu for any shopping.
"
60,Croma,"In spite of requesting almost everyday since 2 months, I have still not received a call from the Fraud Dept who is supposed to detect the fraud happening at Croma Borivali"
60,Croma,"I had a pathetic experience with neu customer care. My order is not yet delivered and it's delayed by 3 days now. Everytime I called the customer care, they told the same thing to wait till EOD, and that they are escalating the matter. But i got no solution. I have such a terrible experience with Tata neu and Croma that I'll never buy stuff from here again, and will recommend my friends to not buy from here too."
60,Croma,Thanks to all the customer care executives for prompt support each time. Heartily thanks to Grievance officer Tata Neu. Wishes all the very best to wonderful team of Croma. Keep it up. 
60,Croma,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"
60,Croma,"In one case where I was unable to place an order for IPhone 13 on Croma website was not resolved after 120 hours. Whereas, in second case, when I booked again an iPhone 13, on Croma online, it was expeditiously resolved. He clearly understood the issue and articulated well and resolved in quick time. "
60,Croma,"It was my first time I have came to Tata Neu app and i have place the order on Tat neu app against this  worder number TC300033802230. 

Then after 3 hours i got a call that this item will be delivered since we don't have stock and one item is damaged so they forced me to cancel this order since I have paid for the same from debit card and my amount is stucked.. i am really disappointed with Tata Experience

They said 

The refund amount will be credited to the original mode of payment within 5-7 working days. Rgds, Team Croma.
But not received yet 
"
60,Croma,"Thanks U Tata neu ,Croma "
60,Croma,If Neu and Croma are of Same Venture i.e Tata then cashback points should be same. Not a good experience of purchasing the product 
60,Croma,Croma store will not listen the customer i have not recieve 580 coin in 30 days and the store behaviour is very poor 
60,Croma,"Cromartie executive didn't know the details of Tata Neu app,how customers would benefit from the app."
60,Croma,"Query is pending for more than 3 weeks now.
Croma has closed the query several times without proper reasoning and no action taken by TataNeu team.
"
60,Croma,Curbside pickup from nearest Croma store should be arranged for fast delivery. 
60,Croma,It was very bad experience with Croma
60,Croma,"Pathetic pathetic pathetic pathetic service by Tata Neu. My order was delivered on Wednesday and till Saturday Installation has not happened. I need compensation of Rs 5,000 for delay in installation. I have not received installation SMS also till today. Whereas other online company as well as Croma is also providing installation of electronic product in 24 hours. "
60,Croma,Unsatisfactory resolution. Poor ethical value displayed by the Croma
60,Croma,Give your website team a tight slap on there face . What shit web page have they made on both Tata neu and Croma  it always loads  only while opening them . Make Tata neu and Croma reachable more by delivering to all locations in india foreign companies like amazon are delivering at all india level but you are not delivering . 
60,Croma,Pathetic & worst experience ever. if u r giving anything free also still wonâ€™t consider from Croma 
60,Croma,"For something as straightforward as my issue (credit of Neucoins for a purchase at Croma store for which the copy of Physical receipt was provided to Customer Care), the amount of time it took to resolve the issue, is preposterous. Secondly, even after the issue was apparently resolved, I kept getting emails (I got at least 3) that it will take another 48 hours for the issue to be resolved. The entire thing seems extremely disjointed "
60,Croma,Why Croma toll free number is chargeable? 
60,Croma,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address..!!?? Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good."
60,Croma,"Customer support Bahut hi achha hai yaar aaplogo ka Matlab Main tata neu ke Whatsapp chat ke through Kisi bhi tata ke partner website jaise tata cliq, Croma, big basket,1mg se chat kar sakta hoon aur woh bhi 24hrs kabhi bhi. Matlab gajab ka customer support hai aaplogo ka "
60,Croma,Need some what plan to exchange Croma voucher to tata cliq cash
60,Croma,"Nobody cares about customer issue, for August 15th purchase of TV still nobody installed from Croma. Today is 9th October. This is how your customer care service is working."
60,Croma,I had great faith with Tata group and ordered Iphone 13promax with Croma inspite of paying Rs119900 on 29th sep 22 you guys couldnt sent it till 8th of Oct 22. very very pathetic services from a very reputed company I am ashamed to place order with you. You must be very proud wasting customers money and time. I want immediate solution deliver it today or return back my money immediately.
60,Croma,"Worst consumer experience ever! The issue was explained in detail to the local manager of Croma in Jalandhar, Punjab."
60,Croma,"I was given good amount of explanation on my query.  Although, I was not very satisfied after placing the order because I received a text message from Croma asking that the payment was not completed and they provided a new link for payment (also tata new app said product not processed until 1 day after purchase). I had purchased the product using Tata Neu App and no Cost EMI option. It is confusing for the customer and might end up paying twice for the product. After the call, I am assured that the product purchase is completed and it is in shipped status. Eagerly waiting for the product to get delivered. Thank You Team."
60,Croma,"Despite buying multiple products from a reputed firm like Croma, I am being harrassed with non replacement of faulty product despite upfront payment. Very bad experience. I bought from Croma because of Tata Group name!!!"
60,Croma,"Worst service, would never suggest Tata neu and Croma to anyone in my life "
60,Croma,"I tried to explain to each agent that I had not cancelled the Croma Order after paying the total amount by Credit Card and that there was a fraud being committed at either Croma or in the NeuCoins department of Tata Neu, but nobody has taken it seriously. I have bee defrauded of 120 - 6 = 114 New Coins"
60,Croma,"Cannot find where to contact customer care executives on your app. I bought a fridge from Croma for over 1.5L, wanted to lodge a complaint for the fridge through Neu app but it was very complicated and i have not done so far."
60,Croma,I got harrassed for seven days without any proper explanation as to what caused the order to vanish from my account. The customer care executives kept on giving me 24 hours wait time to resolve my issue. Finally after 12 days I got my refund but I didn't get the refund of Croma voucher that I also used on the order.
60,Croma,"My Query Is not reslove yet. I Just received Part payment of 4,990 into the card remaining - 25,000 + 25,000 Used by Gift card That's Not refunded yet, Even not reflect into Old gift card, even not received in Croma Wallet."

60,Croma,7 day ho gya mara koi hal nahi hoa Croma team na muja ak bar bi call nahi ki na mara koi hal kiya very bad
60,Croma,"Query was not resolved. I was told that someone would call me regarding my issue, i.e., the neu points for my AC purchased from Croma not reflecting in my account. No one called me. I didn't get my points either...."
60,Croma,"According Croma sales man I spend through your app, but no points indication is there"
60,Croma,I called several times for the installation of my new AC. But no body came to installed yet. Very bad experience with Croma. Very poor service and customer care is useless. I am going to return the product.
60,Croma,I made the in store purchase from Croma after seeing the 5% offer on the Tata Neu app. There was no notification on change in offer that the 5% will be applicable only online and not in store
60,Croma,"ordered one Electronic product from Croma through TATA Neu on 4-4-2022, i selected for Order delivery and the Delivery Adress was 7-2-7/21, Road no 5, Durga Nagar colony in Hyderabad. Some how order got placed in Mumbai. Which is not any of my fault, i have proper adress From my side. After order placed in Mumbai store, i was seeing order is ready to pick up in Mumbai Croma store, which is rediculous. I can't travel from Hyderabad to Mumbai just to pick up a order. I raised an ticket and some person from Mumbai Croma called and i explained the problem. He said he will get back to me. After long time waiting i tried to call him and he is receiving my call and he is playing some recorded message about a costumer care number, which infact not working. Which is rude way to bahave with a costumer. If both Neu Team and Croma team were having proper coordination, this issue could have resolved within 30 minutes. The product which i ordered is in a croma store ( Karnanghat in Hyderabad) just beside my house. Because of your incompetence in resolving the issue on time, i had to cancel my order."

60,Croma,"Need to improve on Product availability on Tata Croma , either at stores or for online purchase"
60,Croma,Was not able to resolve my points credit from Tata Croma (purchase of laptop from store)
60,Croma,I tried multiple time but no executive was assigned. In electronics section you will be able to see no of items bought from Croma however there was no reward coins credited to my account. In most cases I have used my credit card and made the payment.
60,Croma,"Overall very bad experience, my query still not resolved and even Tata neu points not added in my account as per Croma manager , select city walk commitment and also no one call back me from tata neu it seems no one interested in resolving my query"
60,Croma,"Iâ€™ve already waited for 3+ days, thereâ€™s still no resolution. Ticket Id#732360. Haven't received Neucoins for my past 3 transactions on Croma amounting to 1,83,580/-"
60,Croma,"There is a lack of clear information & communication regarding placing orders & NeuCoins reward through TataNeu Portal since itâ€™s redirecting to multiple portals (such as Croma, TataCLiQ, BigBasket, etc.). So the time taken to resolve query & level in the quality meter atleast upto which a concern has to be properly resolved is definitely a miss !!"
60,Croma,The customer service guy was not even pretending to understand my query. I asked for a tracking code for my 13k worth consignment. All they did was redirecting me to the product tracking page with minimal info. Never buying from Neu or Croma!
60,Croma,"I visited the Croma store at Vasant Kunj to purchase two Voltas Air Conditioners. I requested the bill to be made with my GST so I could claim the benefit. While making the bill I was informed that they couldn't enter my full name as the records, entered by someone at a Croma store while making a purchase earlier, had been registered with just my surname. What started then was a process that would put even the most leaden-footed bureaucracies to shame. First I was told to download the TATA Neu app and asked to change my name there. When the app didn't respond, I was informed that it takes only three characters and the name will have to be changed by calling customer care. I called customer care and had Mr. Mahesh attend the call who was very receptive. He asked me to email my Adhar Card and then issued me a ""ticket"". This email was sent at 7 PM and at 12.54 AM I received an email from Mr. Amit Shah asking me to send a Government Approved ID. This was most strange as this email was in response to the email in which I had sent the Adhar Card as an attachment. On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there! This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further."

60,Croma,"The support is good, problem is with the the service and product. Buying experience at both Tata Neu and Croma were underwhelming. Tata Neu fails to complete payment and Croma always succeeds to show products as available until you complete the payment."
60,Croma,Even after purchasing in thousands from Croma the points didnâ€™t get credited to the Tata Neu points. Have been following up with the customer service for past few weeks but NO RESPONSE. Totally frustrated.
60,Croma,No clarity on how police will work. Will Croma offer applies in this app?
60,Croma,Entire experience of Tata Neu has gone down to drain. I had purchased an apple watch last Dec'21 and was given 5% Neu coins as cash back. Again i got the same product in Apr'22 but this time i am not getting Neu coins..the only answer that i am getting from CS is that now it is not part of offer..i was given an assurance from the sales represtative at Croma as well that i will get 5% neu coins...the whole idea of umbrella app is ruined by this.
60,Croma,"Online Order was placed on 12.04.2022on Tata Neu .Material delivered on 15.04.2022 however the date of delivery was upto 14.04.2022. Till date (20.04.2022) AC has not been installed and no communication regarding installation . Contacted customer service representative many times but they are not even able to tell me whether installation of AC shall be done by the representative of Croma or not. And if yes, then when it will be installed. Very P athletic conditions and against the brand name. On the site of croma(Tata Neu) the installation date was from 48-72 Hrs. Now , even I canâ€™t return the product."
60,Croma,"Having already given feedback once, I am getting an email every day asking for feedback. What kind of feedback do you want for spamming? Also, I was told by the Croma store owner that the ACs would be installed in 48 hours. It's 96 hours now and the ACs are still to be installed. I have been calling repeatedly over the past 2 days and all I get to hear from the installation team is, it'll happen in the next 30 minutes!"
60,Croma,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
60,Croma,"I don't think I can recommend Tata Neu to anyone at this point. I just placed 2 orders through Tata Neu so far and I faced major technical issues. On top of it, your customer care executive mentioned that the servers are down since more than a day. This is very disappointing and left me with a bad experience using Tata Neu. I'm still unable to get the product I needed from Croma, even after multiple follow ups."
60,Croma,Didn't get my Neu points due to misguidance from a Croma employee. However there must some way to resolve this as I made a genuine purchase of tata product.
60,Croma,I donâ€™t think my issue with Neu coins was resolved for one of the order placed at BB. Hoping to get the resolution for Croma order .

60,Croma,"Tata Neu is poorest service as I have seen. No refund amount credited after 9 days of refund initiation. When you don't know how to manage services then why you start new services. Poorest service of Croma, Tata cliq, etc."
60,Croma,"Worst shopping experience I have ever had. The customer service personnel are unable to resolve the issues. 10 days after making a successful transaction, there was no order ID. Tata Neu customer service people asked me to call Croma and Croma personnel said there is no such order ID. I asked customer service personnel to escalate the issue and asked for a new order to be placed as the transaction was successful, but they said it was beyond their purview. Pathetic and most harrowing experience. You guys need to go a long long way to be in competition with such careless customer service. God bless you. I am disappointed to see my favourite brand go this way. ??"
60,Croma,My issue is still not solved and I havenâ€™t still got any reply on the status of my request. Purely worst experience. My issue is regarding Tata Neu coins which still have not been added to my account even after 2 weeks of my purchase from Croma store.
60,Croma,Bad experience on the standard installation charges not communicate for Croma split AC.
60,Croma,"I Buyed a product from Croma store, So just wanted to know about mine Tata Neu points but didn't got any response"
60,Croma,"Not sure , I have ordered Croma ac as part of flash deal label on Neu app which was later cancelled , as i felt cheated by Tataâ€™s . the same product was available on another 2 platform amazon and TataCLiQ with exactly same price and sold by croma with free standard installation. Whereas when I inquired at Neu chat support they told me I need to pay installation charges. When the seller is same , brand is company owned , you are labelling it under flash sale then why such discrepancies across channel. Never expected this kind of unethical practice from brand Tata"
60,Croma,no thing called service provided by Croma. the worst online etailer.
60,Croma,"Very slow peocessing and time wasting App. I purchased Voltas 1.5 ton AC deivered on18 Apr 22 and delayed installed on 24 Apr 22. After installation 1 day AC stop cooling and error occured 5d & 6E. I register complaint on daily to daily min 5 time with croma cust care but till 02 May no technician visit at my house and till AC is off road/not working. Very bad experience with Croma, Voltas & Tata neu app. Waste my time, waste my money....."
60,Croma,Not able to make payment online to purchase the iPhone and there is not same offer in offline Croma store. Ended up paying extra in Croma store rather than ordering on tataneu
60,Croma,I had purchased mobile phone from Croma n was told tataneu points would be added to my account within 48 hrs of purchase but still haven't been added after over a month.. Also i stayed at taj malabar resort n spa cochin for 5 days n was told once u check out the points would be added to your account.. Its almost a week & no points have been added.. Inspite of complaining to customer service still the tataneu account shows 0 points..
60,Croma,"I've so far had a very poor experience with not only Tata Neu app, but Tata Digital overall. The Neu app always crashes when I try to make payments, causing another stir of issues with the bank and cards. The Tata Croma website incorrectly shows availability of products and orders fail even after making the complete payment. I appreciate that the customer care is available 24x7 and I have almost recieved a good response from the executives, but the issue, now 3 weeks old, still hasnt been resolved."
60,Croma,"I placed request for my speakers and executives on call talked like I'm the one complaing without any merit to my problem and kept saying that it can't be taken back and kept refusing to send up a pick up team and made a request to speaker company for repairing rather than arranging for a pickup. I used to shop at amazon and I tried Croma for the 1st time just because I love the TATA, now this seems to be turning as nightmare for me atleast. SR27042200618"

Also app shows me your Ac is installed, But this is Totally Wrong because Ac is not installed, I am daily Chat and they said ""please wait for 3 Days. Keep In mind if you want to be a big brand than improve your service otherwise customer switch to Amazon, Because Amazon Fulfill Ac installation in 24 hours from delivery of products. Also Your Croma Helpline is not Working, â˜¹ï¸"
60,Croma,"I installed this app, and when I wanted to make a transaction (around â‚¹9,500) at Westside it rejected, imposing a limit of â‚¹5,000. If I am making a transaction then it isn't upto you whether I will perform a transaction of lesser amount. When I contacted customer care to provide necessary neu points they straight away rejected, stating that this is an offline transaction. Then I did another transaction of â‚¹700 in Croma, the app straight away gave an error. What's the point of using this app where I cannot get neu points and the transaction doesn't succeed. Sorry but I am not going to use this customer unfriendly app."
60,Croma,I have been given a TATA Qik EMI card which has a limit of 100000 but is not showing up as a payment option when I try to shop in the Croma website through the app. I dont see a point of having a card with limit when I can use it
60,Croma,"I'm TCS employee, When I installed first Tata Neu there is a option in finance like Qik EMI, So I applied and 4 representatives made me do it and said you can avail in croma and other stores. Day before yesterday I thought to buy a smart phone so I checked in Tata Neu there is no option to avail the EMI for any electronics, I thought to go to croma store , nearest store is around 140 Kms ,I went there. They said no option to use Qik EMI ,I only have Debit cards so I can't avail the EMI and I came back. I know Croma is Tata subsidiary , but there not giving customers to use Tata Capital benefits, I made a mistake to take Qik EMI card and installing Tata Neu app. Very bad on these issues."
60,Croma,"1. Cashback offers that are available on Croma are not available on Tata Neu linked Croma 2. No option to purchase from another Croma account from single Tata Neu account 3. If someone wishes to avail offer twice, it is not possible"
60,Croma,"Talking about TATA neu, one can say it's successful only if the below conditions are met: 1. Most of your products are undeliverable outside metro cities and so far after raising so many concerns nothing being done. So why would I buy 1 product with TATA and others look for somewhere. 2. Though bringing of all the items under TATA was good through Neu, there are many products missing from the online store. I would suggest all the products to be run on a single app other than using 1mg, Croma or a TATA cliq."
60,Croma,"I have place Symphony cooler on tata neu app, it was not showing under my order section. I called customer care thrice and they confirmed that they have received my order request and suddenly I got order cancellation email from tata Croma the day I was waiting for my product to be delivered. Is this a joke going on."
60,Croma,"Very Bad service from Croma, Tata Capital,Tata Neu. In 14-20 Days Not got the refund."
60,Croma,"I don't have any issue with customer care but my concern is for Croma. First time i received defective piece (someone used piece), so initiated return and second time ordered same piece but this time damaged parcel ( with opened condition there is no thermocol on bottom ). When I requested for immediate new piece in another 72 hrs there is no ownership at all. Based on this personal experience strongly not recommended for anyone else. Many things has to be improved quality, customer care ownership, application is very slow, order tracking not up to date ( portal got updated after 2 days once product delivered)."
60,Croma,Order item is not delivered even after 4 days of scheduled arrival date. No body at Tata Neu and Croma is able to solve
60,Croma,"Tata Neu is bouquet of Tata services under 1 platfoorm. It would've been better if Tata management understand what are existing issues in existing services before actually creating this bouquet. I placed order for refrigerator which was showing next day delivery. As it didn't delivered i cancelled order next day 11pm. 2-3 call center representatives confirmed my cancelation, still despatched refrigerator after 7 days. I didn't except the order, still it was marked delivered. Now my money got stucked as the product is showing delivered. Now i have to convince your team that i have not received the product and money should be refunded. Now this will tell you there are issues in so many levels in Croma service."
60,Croma,Very Bad service from Croma Tata Capital Tata Neu
60,Croma,Very bad apps my order is 01/05/2022 . My account to pay.2834.10. my order decline my payment is not refund in 14 day very bad Tata NeuCroma team
60,Croma,One last time using Croma to book Electronics. No update on MI TV installation even after 2 days
60,Croma,"I have placed an order from Tataneu in Croma online, money was debited from my account, transaction was successful but the order was not placed. Customer care was not able to help with the issue, they say issue was escalated to concerned team and it'll take 3days to resolve. Why do you need 3 days to check on a simple issue with a transaction?"
60,Croma,My order for a smart watch was canceled after the contractual delivery date without any advance information. I was to gift the same to my spouse and missed the occasion due to non delivery of the gift . I do not think TATA required working capital and blocked my fund for almost a week and canceled the order. If adequate stocks were not available the order should not have been accepted. My experience with Tataneu/ Croma was really bad. The smart watch was promised to be delivered at a discounted rate while ordering and immediately after cancellation of the order same watch was also available on the website for fresh ordering at a higher cost This reflects poor business ethics Regards Subrat Ph9920018821
60,Croma,Product is good but Tata Neu / Croma need to take ownership for the delivery date which they promise... Promising next day delivery and delivering after 3 days Customer care guys dont have much to do except telling what is already known to customer
60,Croma,"please solved my issue. Dear sir, I have purchased the V-Gaurd Voltage stabiliser model VG-400 from TATA Neu app and then go through Croma on 15 may 2022. Till now my order is not shown in the TATA Neu app nor Croma. I am not sure if it will be ordered or not. i was purchased it urgently as its show delivery date is 19 may2022. Only translation details are shown in the TATA NEU app and the same is complained in TATA NEU and croma also but no response. with Regards SKMishra 9926094937/7987046120"
60,Croma,"CC Exe are all dumb. That can't understand a simple equation. The girl and the boy kept on talking about cashback, which was not the issue at all. The issue is about 2 Digital Gift Cards which I used online & afterwards I cancelled the order. The GC balance is now showing Zero . This has be be refilled/recharged ., or refunded to Wallet of Croma/Tata Neu if has any. The amount is 5000 & 500 Rs respectively. GC No 1001340042219485. & 1001340048367920. Education UR call center agents."
60,Croma,You all just make fool to the customers. Very bad experience with Tata Croma.
60,Croma,Tata 's image is going to a new low. Selling such low quality products online. Croma is a fraud company. It's customer care number is fake. Croma after sales is the worst in India. Buy any products online at your own risk
60,Croma,I bought from Tata Neu because I love the Tata brand but this time Croma failed to prove its services and customer service. Bad customer service.
60,Croma,Customer care executive was not controlling croma technician. Croma technician was rude. Installation was not standard as per my suggestion and compare to other AC at my home. Technician was also not ready to learn any new thing and was doing work as per his mood.
60,Croma,"30 April & 5 May I purchased from Croma Calicut around 90000rs ; Store team told me Tata neu coins will added within 15 days ; very disappointed to say nothing will credited from any where, itâ€™s very cheating from the Tata side, Calicut manager and sales team not support, No one knows offers or coins details, I have lots of Corparate orders, I want to purchase from Croma or any Tata concerns,but these types of ambiance and attitude No need future buy from Croma; Sales staff as billing staff ;need improve the knowledge of offers and neu coins , TATA is a major leading company in our country So sadly said that Customer satisfaction nothing. Sadly say that I will never purchase from Tata Croma anymore."
60,Croma,"I purchased a mobile phone from Tata neu app. Instead of getting 5 neu coins per 100, I got less. I also emailed a video (which I had to make as this thing has he opened earlier to me also) to the customer care team. It clearly shows I have purchased from Tata neu, still the customer care is disagreeing an saying that I have purchased from Croma website. If you see my history of purchases, I have been buying a lot of items from Tata neu. I am not happy with the current status of my problem. Tata neu has less varieties and higher costs in some items, still supporting the app as itâ€™s made in India. But if the customer care wonâ€™t support properly, I am not likely to suggest this to my friends. Thanks."
60,Croma,I interacted with 2 agents. Both lacked initiative and basic information. They even shared outdated phone numbers for contacting Croma
60,Croma,My concern is still not resolved and I am waiting for reply from Croma regarding return. Till now I have followed steps told to me by customer care executive. Let's see
60,Croma,The app lags too much. Many people have given this app worst ratings still the app developers doing nothing... Croma only have few electronic product comparing to other shopping brands. It's like you don't care about customer experience and just care about 5% neu coins.
60,Croma,"Team Croma online, Doesn't care customer, doesn't respond quickly. I would not recommend anyone to buy products from Croma from my experience. Worst experience ever in buying online products at Croma."
60,Croma,"I ordered Elica Gas Stove from Tata Croma and its been already 48 hours plus since its delivered, but there is no update on when technician will come for installation. Everyday I am following up with tata croma customer care and they keep saying wait for 7 days max to resolve, I don't understand why does it take 7 days to send technician for installation? Do you expect customer to keep the item without opening or using until 7 days?"

60,Croma,No solution despite repeated follow ups with CS on purchases made through Tata Neu/ Big Basket & Croma. Too many bugs in the system.
60,Croma,The behave like bots and why you donâ€™t give the tracking id on the Croma very bad it is
60,Croma,"Bought Symphony air cooler on 1st May, 22 which stopped working on 6/5/22. Unable to get replacement. No return request honored. No one is coming to see what the problem is with the product. Tickets getting closed by Croma Backend team without technician attending it"
60,Croma,"My order is still not delivered. Money is deducted but no response on my order delivery from Tata Neu. Being an employee of Croma , This is my worst every shopping experience. If anyone is reading this, Please call me on 9819777107 to resolve my query"
60,Croma,I asked for Neu cash on 14th May against the purchase I made at Croma and till the date it has not been credited to my account. I deleted the app after this experience with you
60,Croma,Very casual and sub-standard customer care. Ticket closed without resolution. Croma purchase of 7 May yet to reflect on app and points credited. No resolution provided by your team.
60,Croma,I have called the customer care team twice to raise an issue of not getting Neu Coins for my recent purchase at Croma Stores. I have been promised that within 72 hours the coins would get credited in my account. I am still waiting. I dont intend to call anymore and would like to escalate. I feel being taken for a ride and this is my first bitter experience with Tata Group
60,Croma,Crap platform. Payments fail or go on hold. Shopping partner Croma did not acknowledge order due to use of gift card. One of the disgusting shopping & payment groups in India. Cheap homegrown mindset.
61,TATA Neu,Creating a new account with TATA Neu is  cumbersome. Usually  the Neu symbol just keeps on changing colour with no hint on what to do next.  I had to take help of your customer care executive Ashwini before finally succeeding in getting on board. The process needs to be more interactive. Your IT Team has a lot of work ahead
61,TATA Neu,Will not recommended TATA Neu to anyone if this level of service continues. 
61,TATA Neu,"Very delayed response and if the cult app is included in TATA Neu, all the information about it should be available to customer care to support the customer."
61,TATA Neu,"What about my booking (TC300028174620). It's been 72 hours since I was bothered by this problem but till now no positive response has been received from your company. The point of the extent is that my order is not visible to me (On Neu App and croma website), neither to your store manager (from where to pick up) nor to your customer care. Whereas I bought the laptop on Friday, June 24, 2022 at 11:50PM. How will you survive in this competitive era in front of online platforms like Amazon and Falikart etc.. ?? Yesterday I have mailed to CEO Mr Avijit Mitra Sir because of very much upset, Very poor sarvice of TATA Neu I'm so annoyed that you couldn't possibly do your best to help me."
61,TATA Neu,Very poor service of TATA Neu
61,TATA Neu,"ordered one Electronic product from Croma through TATA Neu on 4-4-2022, i selected for Order delivery and the Delivery Adress was 7-2-7/21, Road no 5, Durga Nagar colony in Hyderabad. Some how order got placed in Mumbai. Which is not any of my fault, i have proper adress From my side. After order placed in Mumbai store, i was seeing order is ready to pick up in Mumbai Croma store, which is rediculous. I can't travel from Hyderabad to Mumbai just to pick up a order. I raised an ticket and some person from Mumbai Croma called and i explained the problem. He said he will get back to me. After long time waiting i tried to call him and he is receiving my call and he is playing some recorded message about a costumer care number, which infact not working. Which is rude way to bahave with a costumer. If both Neu Team and Croma team were having proper coordination, this issue could have resolved within 30 minutes. The product which i ordered is in a croma store ( Karnanghat in Hyderabad) just beside my house. Because of your incompetence in resolving the issue on time, i had to cancel my order."

61,TATA Neu,Great experience! Thank you TATA Neu.
61,TATA Neu,"I am using such type of plateform such as Paytm and pehone for last 5 years. I never faced such type of issue , what I faced on first transaction. Today is the 5th day , but my problem stand still. I can not advised any one to use TATA Neu"
61,TATA Neu,"I visited the Croma store at Vasant Kunj to purchase two Voltas Air Conditioners. I requested the bill to be made with my GST so I could claim the benefit. While making the bill I was informed that they couldn't enter my full name as the records, entered by someone at a Croma store while making a purchase earlier, had been registered with just my surname. What started then was a process that would put even the most leaden-footed bureaucracies to shame. First I was told to download the TATA Neu app and asked to change my name there. When the app didn't respond, I was informed that it takes only three characters and the name will have to be changed by calling customer care. I called customer care and had Mr. Mahesh attend the call who was very receptive. He asked me to email my Adhar Card and then issued me a ""ticket"". This email was sent at 7 PM and at 12.54 AM I received an email from Mr. Amit Shah asking me to send a Government Approved ID. This was most strange as this email was in response to the email in which I had sent the Adhar Card as an attachment. On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there! This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further."

61,TATA Neu,Please integrate Neu UPI with SBI or major banks. This will not only help users but also help TATA Neu team.
61,TATA Neu,"Customer Service Representative not at all understanding my issue. I am still trying to reach them but they are not responding to my mail. As being a TCS employee, I really feel bad about the service provided by the TATA Neu platform."
61,TATA Neu,"TATA Neu is acting like a fraud organization. Even after successful payment, order is not confirmed due to ""so called"" technical issues and after 96 hours support team is unable to close the issue. Feeling cheated by TATA."
61,TATA Neu,"I didn't receive the neu coins for the flight tickets that I booked through the TATA Neu app, The Flight was initially booked by TATA Neu, however, the flight got Rescheduled by Air Asia, As per the customer care , it is Air Asia's fault that i couldn't get Neu Coins This is not a behavior that is Expected from a TATA Group Company, If it is the Response of the Group employees then what would be with others. You are requested to Resolve these issues and take this instance as learning."
61,TATA Neu,TATA Neu App refreshes sometimes and payments page got closed which caused me to contact the customer support representative for assistance...
61,TATA Neu,First couldnâ€™t provide update on my order and then on confirmed cancellation received 3 calls asking for same cancellation or have I received the product. Lastly have no visibility on my refund as the status on TATA Neu continues to be incorrect
61,TATA Neu,Extremely dissapointed with TATA Neu
61,TATA Neu,I need and awaiting for a resolution since 10days..what you gonna do with customers pains caused by you people and TATA Neu Team
61,TATA Neu,"I have purchased a JBL Headphone on 1st March 2022, in Shivamogga, Karnataka -577201 with the mobile no: 8971034402 But I have raised the concern regarding TATA New coins for the worth of Rs 4999/-. Still I have not received the TATA Neu coins. Order No: SOA2720000319999 . Name of the staff- Lavith G"
61,TATA Neu,"TATA Neu needs to expand the products availability. There are many products which are available on Amazon, Flipkart or even Jio but not on Tata Neu. I understand it will take a while to reach that stage but felt worth to share the feedback."
61,TATA Neu,"please solved my issue. Dear sir, I have purchased the V-Gaurd Voltage stabiliser model VG-400 from TATA Neu app and then go through Croma on 15 may 2022. Till now my order is not shown in the TATA Neu app nor Croma. I am not sure if it will be ordered or not. i was purchased it urgently as its show delivery date is 19 may2022. Only translation details are shown in the TATA NEU app and the same is complained in TATA NEU and croma also but no response. with Regards SKMishra 9926094937/7987046120"
61,TATA Neu,Excellent. TATA Neu is another Feather to the cap of TATA group.
62,customer support team,"I am not satisfied with customer support team, they way took 20days to resolve one issue."
62,customer support team,"The customer support team is really great at what theyâ€™re doingâ€¦. The only feedback I wanted to give was about the Croma website, which dosenâ€™t have the updated Tata Neu Customer Care number and this causes trouble for the customersâ€¦ Thanks"
62,customer support team,I was not allowed to explain the issue clearly and 2-3 calls and emails from the customer support team explaining what they think the issue was and the best part was no resolution except saying try JustPay which i have no clue what is it...Anyways stopped using Tata Neu unless i am forced to and using other apps which are quite smooth...Listen to the customer first rather than trying to be oversmart...
62,customer support team,"Your customer support team is the worst. They have closed the ticket without completing my refund and resolving the issue. Atif, Damodaran, Vijay and team are lying and not fit for their job."
62,customer support team,"Firstly no one called. I only got a response thru email. The English of email is extremely poor which can not be the Tata Standard. Secondly, no satisfactory answer offered. I doubt that my point was understood by the customer support team."
62,customer support team,A query raised is taking more than a month to be resolved.....The customer support team has been trained only to seek apology but not to resolve a concern
62,customer support team,"Everytime new support executive respond to the same issue with new timeline and excuses for technical glitches without any explanation. The replies look to be very general and without any thoughts on the problem. My first purchase experience too bad to forget, doesn't expected such services from a organisation of TATA. Technical glitches are normal for new launching but the customer support team should be proactive and provide real solutions rather than providing standard copy paste response."
62,customer support team,It took 11 days just to listen to my doubt. Extremely poor customer support team
62,customer support team,It has been more than a month but there is no revert from the customer support team. I have spoken to them multiple times and I get a 72 hour resolution promise everytime.
62,customer support team,"When I was talking with Customer Service Representative He correctly not given reply also ,,,too much late reply.... Next he told me to Resolve my issue i have to write âœï¸ the email to customer support team ,,,then why he is working the customer service??????? Stil my issue is pending"
62,customer support team,"Since last 2 day I , I am facing trouble to cancel my order.. there is no customer support team, cancellation of product is not available on the tata neu application."
63,Navigation page,Navigation page needs to be little fast and improved for easy accessibility
64,Tata group,"Good customer service, executive given me immediately answers which i wanted to know. The most thing is u people actually here & then response which is the comforting factor frm a customer point. Absolutely loved it, it's new & exciting. Since it's from the Tata group it'll be more trustworthy n reliable. I went to the app, it's great. I'm impressed wid ur idea n appreciate ur efforts. Thanks service. 
For Ticket - 1475994."
64,Tata group,Nothing was done. 526 rupees was looted from me. Tata group is trying to become Adani?
64,Tata group,Definitely confirm to Tata capital middle class people helping Nature to Ratan Tata and entertain team thanks to Tata group
64,Tata group,I had great faith with Tata group and ordered Iphone 13promax with Croma inspite of paying Rs119900 on 29th sep 22 you guys couldnt sent it till 8th of Oct 22. very very pathetic services from a very reputed company I am ashamed to place order with you. You must be very proud wasting customers money and time. I want immediate solution deliver it today or return back my money immediately.
64,Tata group,The issue has not been resolved and they have the close the ticket automatically. Not expected from Tata group
64,Tata group,"Still not able to solve the problem, leading to loss of business for the Tata group. Only wasting my time by asking for screenshots and other information."
64,Tata group,Regarding the app - The ticket is in resolved status but no option to reopen as I still have queries Regarding customer care - again they have not addressed how my corporate benefits can be used on app as I know TCS employees are part of Tata group and get discount on most products on NEU so my question was how to use and response was no offers which is surely false ?
64,Tata group,"Pathatic customer service I have ever seen, spoiling The name of Tata group, wonâ€™t recommend this to anyone ??"
64,Tata group,"very disappointed , not expected from a Tata group company"
64,Tata group,"No body knows the solution of a problem, didnot expect this from Tata group"
64,Tata group,"I'm dissatisfied with the service provided to me. Even after paying money online, I had to wait for 3 days just to get a response form query. I didn't waited for 3 days just to get a refund. How do I recommend this app to someone else when even employees of Tata group are facing these kind of issues."
64,Tata group,"The application doesnâ€™t stay online & so are the coins credits. However, redemption is prompt. Further, the application canâ€™t do simple arithmetics. Today I have three queries that are unresolved. I believe that with the way things are going, it may take considerable time to resolve simple matters of coins not rewarded for my stays at Taj. I have even sent invoicesâ€¦ Almost 10 days have gone by and thereâ€™s no response. Your chatbot is pathetic and frustrating & so are the executives on the other end. They canâ€™t resolveâ€¦ so why have them. I donâ€™t know how much this makes sense to you,,, but you have an unhappy customer who admires Mr. Ratan Tata & heâ€™s the reason for my continued patronage with Tata group."
64,Tata group,No proper response for my query and itâ€™s been 3 weeks still my raised ticket is open. Didnâ€™t expect this from Tata group.
64,Tata group,"Unless u have better customer service, its going to be total failure. Being an tata employee i feel bad for Tata group."
64,Tata group,"I stayed at Taj Dubai in March and spent close to $10,000/- I have not received any points against this stay in spite of calling the various teams 10 times. I can expect this sort of service from a government concern not from a Tata group company"
64,Tata group,Fake organisation and never buy product from this app and I stop buying product from Tata group
64,Tata group,Awesome intiative by Tata group..Great way to go..
65,refund,"Its been 20 days and i havent been provided with neither my product nor my refund. It's the worst service i have ever experienced 
I would recommend noone to use your app or your service "

65,refund,Many time email and customer care call than long time after may payment is refund 40 day around time so not happy this service 
65,refund,We are facing cancellation or refund problem 
65,refund,"Yes. I placed order on 12-7-2022.
The order not executed n refund not made till date even after assured your 8 customer care executives promissed."
65,refund,"Very late refund , received after 10 working days"
65,refund,Sorry Tataneu very bad experience because order cancelled that's ok but refund process was delayed and slowly working on Tataneu app need to refund status checking  in the same Tataneu application  also thank you.
65,refund,Didn't get refund from 2 days. Wrost Application. 
65,refund,Worst customer support didn't receive my refund yet
65,refund,My refund quary is not resolved in 15 days
65,refund,I placed my order and after successful payment...it was not delivered to me . I got the information that the item is out of stock after 5 days of placing my order. And i have yet to to receive the refund.
65,refund,I placed a return request  nearly 10 days ago and till date no one has showed up for pick up and no refund.  I am constantly following up and it's a pain . Pathetic experienece will never recommend anyone 
65,refund,I told customer care 23 times and they said they resolve problem but still my refund not credit in my bank account.. 
65,refund,"Till today my issue is not resolved yet, wrost experience with this transaction. 
Please update the status of my transaction 
Either resolve my issue or refund me 
"
65,refund,Issue was never resolved. The advisor had no idea on refund timeline for the coupon. 
65,refund,"I have got refund which i paid through credit card, but i didn't get croma voucher refund."
65,refund,Till the date I have not received full refund 
65,refund,The executive had to check with wher manager for the corrective solution. The response was literally copy pasted from the managers discussion. I haven't got my refund from the failed order at tata Neu - big basket yet. Hence disappointed. There are high chances of the payment getting failed at the UPI/Tata Neu gateway. This needs to be checked please.
65,refund,"Your query process is very slow, you take so much time to reply the query of customer. I have lodged complain regarding my croma refund but still after 2 day there is no any response or any confirmation mail  from your side. Please improve your service like Amazon."
65,refund,"Customer Executive should reply the query not only the standard operative guidelines replies serve the purpose.
Like I was ask8ng for the transaction ID by which Refund is initiated , the standard replies were given ""we regret for the inconvenience it takes 5-7 days for credit of refund , please wait for 48 hes"" The waiting period was already 15 days over."
65,refund,"I really had terrible experience, as the pick up store was changed without informing, plus when I visited another store the stock did not last, while it showed ready to pick up in my app and above it no one cancelled the order as promised by Croma employee.

Above it my payment is not  processed though its 15th day, and that too, I had to make a complaint for refund; should it have been suo moto, I would be more happy as this created a negative impression in my mind about Neu that in future if there is issue with order, my funds are not safe, as refunds are not done on time neither Neu team cares about informing status to customer on itself, it is the customer who has to go and beg for his refund.

I would never prefer croma or neu for any shopping.

65,refund,"My query was regardind refund in forms of neu coins for a cancelled order on tata cliq. Here tata cliq is the product of TATA. Neu coins are the product of TATA. Here in my case no third party or bank was involved , only tata's products were involved. Still it took 10 days to resolve the query. Qorst service by TATA. Thus is my second experience regarding TATA products where first and second level cystomer services are very poor. Previously a year ago i had to contact up to the level of the CEO of tata aia insurance for solution of my query related to my health policy."
65,refund,Pathetic experience as almost 4 days has been taken even after multiple follow ups and escalation for initiate refund. Where I see other merchants like Flipkart and amazons are providing instant refund.
65,refund,"Pls provide email id, contact details for raising complaint in the customer profile section.
Refund should be in bank account and not in wallet.
There was no option available to see where my refund was credited. No intimation was provided regarding refund. "

65,refund,"The worst shopping and customer care experience ever! Never shopping from Tata Neu again. Just to get an update on my order, it took more than 72 hours. Plus my order did not even get delivered. My refund has not been initiated. The customer care executive I spoke to first did not even understand the issue and says things like because a sale is ongoing on Westside products they couldn't handle my order. If an order cannot be handled by such a big brand it's better to shut it down for good. Never shopping from you and I am going to spread the word among my friends and family as well."
65,refund,"There was no resolution to my query. The customer executive stated it was a technical glitch due to which my order 122371107 was showing as ""payment timeout"" despite my credit card having been debited for the said amount. I was told I would get a refund, but I would have preferred my order to have been delivered instead. The app doesn't seem to be working to satisfactory level and should not be placed in the public domain until the glitches are sorted. Very disappointed!"
65,refund,Even after my bankdebited my account your app was showing payment as pending.That is why Icancelled the order.Still waiting for refund

I did not get refund for order returned due to delay delivery. I have cancelled one item on 10 August amd for that i got refund on 25th August. Two Items I  have denied to recieve on 15 August sue to delay delivery still did not get any refund. How pathetic service tata neu has. One of the worst platform and poor service. You don't have any system and process for execution. Amazon, Flipkart and other platforms doesn't take more than 2-4 day's and here is tata neu which shamelessly replies on email that we are processing it. And that's processing is not even start from last 20 days. "
65,refund,A refund of Rs.1195 is awaited from Tataneu for cancelled Big basket order KMKCO-266598836-290882 for 7 items. The order was  cancelled on 30 August 2022. Please expedite the refund
65,refund,Even to take back a defective product it took several days by your team and I was only receiving emails after emails but no action. Now there is no noise about refund of my money. Tata Neu is a colossal failure I believe and would strongly advise my acquaintances to avoid using it for online purchase and prefer Amazon and Flipkart for their outstanding services. 
65,refund,"So much bad experience with tata neu
Still not received my refund amount 6770
Which should be refund in 7days but last 2&half month not received yet."
65,refund,"The customer was not central to the resolution but they were more focused on the process and took more than 10 days to resolve and made me lose taking medication stating it will be delivered and the money will not be refunded, finally to trace the refund it took them almost ten days, least expected out of TATAs after subscribing to their premium 1mg services "
65,refund,Order was cancelled on 21st of October and despite my repeated calls refund is not processed till a week. Pathetic customer care service
65,refund,Customer care me koi bat sunta hi nhi or jab mera order complete hua uske 2 din bad order cancel kar Diya kyuki price high krne k bad  or mere ko bolte he aapko refund milega AAP dusra order kr lo order karke mere ko 600 ki nuksani
65,refund,"I have had not so good experience with the fruits/vegetables quality / delivery from Big Basket. Sometimes not all the products ordered for are delivered, and sometimes the quality of fruits/vegetables is below the acceptable range. Although the returns / refunds have been done quickly by the customer service team, but the convenience of ordering online takes a beating because of quality of items and return/refund process (as it allows only one return / exchange per order). "
65,refund,If our refund is shifted to our big basket wallet then inform us 
65,refund,"My refund still not credited in my credit card

65,refund,"Please arrange to improve your refund system. Ideally the customers should be able to get their refunds, especially due to non-availability of some items and part or full cancellation by the seller, within 24-48 hours. Making the customers wait for days together due to no fault on their part is not fair."
65,refund,I had to cancel the order. Talked to customer care when I was directed to hotel staff. I could cancel. But refund not done yet. Again reached to customer care for call back but saw email came late night for further information and then received message that call closed and also email confirmation on successful delivery of order. I have not received the order. Need the refund ASAP.
65,refund,"My 5th order was cancelled even after order successful status. I cant believe why they have created this app if no one can order. Customer service is pathetic, they are not listening to customer and saying you will get refund and place again fresh order.

65,refund,I didnâ€™t get my refund yet but the mail which Tata neu croma send says the refund is credited to my account and poor response from costumer care executives
65,refund,I got harrassed for seven days without any proper explanation as to what caused the order to vanish from my account.

65,refund,"My order got cancelled due to inprofessional delivery guy , & dont know exect status of my refund as well."

65,refund,"The issue was not all resolved, till date. Requesting the Tata Neu Team to kindly resolve the issue and refund the cancellation amount of Rs.262 to Credit card and 37 Neu Coins."
65,refund,Infrastructure to process is pathetic. I have been waiting for 1 month to have my refund. Thereâ€™s no way to reach anyone in Tata 1 mg via phone but only by email or chatâ€¦ None of them have any experience in medicine or medical fields or e-commerce. Theyâ€™re are just dummies to apologise again and agin without giving any resolution to my problems. This feedback is mainly to Tata 1 mg customer care.
65,refund,"Very dissatisfied, sales exec Aalam did not know what he was doing, double ordered meds and my refund is not paid or logged in my account"
65,refund,The customer care executive could not guide me to something as basic as the BB wallet. I had a query regarding the refund of two undelivered products by Big Basket.

65,refund,My refund query is still pending
65,refund,Pathetic experience Order canceled automatically and still refund not received

65,refund,"my refund was not done for 1 month, after talking to customer care it was told will be done in 72 hrs, but it took 10 days to get refund after following up for 3 times."
65,refund,haven't received my refund yet
65,refund,No waiting for call .direct connected with customers care executive.and right information no eye wash.i received wrong product got returned.refund pending .hope I will get soon my refund
65,refund,"Kindly improve payment system, payment features, refund timing, includes train booking etc."
65,refund,"Worst experience of Tata Neo, they detected the payment, transaction shows failedâ€¦ they say 5 to 7 days for refund. Amazon does it in few minutes"
65,refund,I have done for the order and money was deducted and you stated payment was failed . Make a good payment gateway. I didn't refund till now. When will I get my money back i didn't order anything now. Disastrous
65,refund,Poor UPI service never use again refund time for 5 to 7 days.
65,refund,"the issue was , why electricity bill was not paid when the money already debit from my debit card.... well as per tata neu, i will get refund in next 5 days.... lets see... and what about the payments.... if for the payment i have to switch to amazon as it clearly shows that tata neu app is not able to paying the bill then why i need tata neu app?"
65,refund,"My issue with pending refund has not been resolved. The customer care is always eager to close the complaint tickets without providing resolution or making any progress on the issue. The whole experience of repeated reminders, requests and calls is harrowing to say the least. Extremely disappointed."
65,refund,Agent was very much aware of what customer expects but my query wasn't addressed due to internal mechanism. Had to wait for few more days for refund
65,refund,Payments doesn't work. It's failed twice and still no update on refund. How am I supposed to payback credit card bill it refund doesn't processed within time.
65,refund,Pls don't need this app ...i got payment debited but still I didn't get phone main thing I'm talking with customer care he said for 7 working days ..no phone money debited again need to wait for 7 days for refund why should all these headache just becoz of this app...pls don't make customer fools..becoz you don't know that how that money come from just simply 7 days it's easy but what about customer choice that phone is important for him can't even think for customer side .. simply technical issues all those stupid stuff.why should i need to msg all for this ..just becoz tata companies _/\_ pls don't spoil true legends names...will you help me out for this transaction
65,refund,Ur not responding properly I lost around 5777 rs by useing ur app i Don't know weather it will be refunded or not 5000 in UPI and 777 in bil payment to mescom
65,refund,"Never got a response from the customer representative. No message or intimation of what will happen to the transaction amount (will it be refunded, I hope it will, in how many hours/days/weeks, no message) I am completely in the dark about the status. Very disappointed."
65,refund,My issue didn't resolve yet. Didn't receive the refund for the technical issues of tata neu app. Worst app ever. No call received from the customer care executive
65,refund,"We have booked one order and we did not get that order delivered by big basket , where as order directly placed via big basket how ever that order did not deliver Later we cancelled reimbursement was not received just because I have recommended this app , I have paid all the refund to the one who booked in this worst and customer service has no idea what's going on"
65,refund,Simple request for return of Product is placed on the day of delivery still no one is looking into it?? For processing return request why so much time required?? Other App allowing Returns without Questions & very fast process of refund/replacement. I was expecting Tata will give competition to these foreign companies but my first experience is totally disappointing.
65,refund,Not recommended my friends .my fist payment was filled .and refund long time
65,refund,I am struggling for a transaction of DTH recharge which is stuck and showing status as pending from hours and each time your customer care executives are asking me to wait and telling me that either my connection will get recharged or will get refund within 5 to 7 days. Kindly explain me that how can I wait when my DTH subscription is about to expire in few hours.
65,refund,"The issue was not resolved by tata neu executive. I contacted him yesterday night but till now it was not resolved. Just now I contacted big basket and issue was resolved in 2 minutes. At first I chat with him on WhatsApp, he asked me to send the pics of the product in WhatsApp. I did so.He told he couldn't open it. Why so? He then shared and asked me to send a mail with pics. I did so? He replied and told that the issue will be resolved soon. But it didn't. 1. Issues should be addressed on time. 2. He was polite but the result was zero. 3. No customer will wait so long. 4. If you want to compete with Flipkart and Amazon the customer care should be quick and effective. Eg: The rate at which swiggy initiate refund is impressive. 5. I liked the use of WhatsApp. It's unique. But unfortunately he couldn't open the pics I sent. I don't know why? It kind of destroyed my mood to do business with you. 6. The customer care service should be seamless and he shouldn't be tired of waiting for your response. 7. You should keep a deadline to resolve to solve the issue, something like timeline to deliver the result. Like Zomato did while making delivery. 8. He understood the issue and was really supportive and polite. But as customer my issue was not solved. That's the reason I contacted him."
65,refund,I still donâ€™t know what is the exact status .. the communications are not clear. There is a huge grey area. Whether my order stands firm or cancel? If Iâ€™ll receive the refund .. etc .. I can be reached at 9819448088
65,refund,"My payment failed because of a technical issue in Neu App, it was debited from my bank account immediately. However, I have been told to place another order pay the same amount again and wait for 7 days to get a refund. How is this fair? Refund should be either immediate or within 24 hours. Why should I wait for 7 days to get my own money back?"
65,refund,Money got deducted but order did not get placed. Money should get refunded within same day instead its taking more than week.
65,refund,My bill was due on 22 April when the amount will when I have to pay that bill again please Tata send the refund on Monday asap
65,refund,I have been raising a refund issue for more than a month now without any resolution yet.
65,refund,"1st Transaction with your app and i landed in trouble and now will have to payment due charges also because of your app. Also, your team does not have clue where my money is pending and when it will be refunded Despite of sharing everything they have not done anything from past 48 hours"
65,refund,My money has not been refunded. Also adding an address correctly is a pain and still is not reflected correctly
65,refund,"My refund is stuck for 15days and counting, since I returned it. This way Tata Neu is not going far."
65,refund,I am still waiting for refund of the transaction failed.
65,refund,"It's more than 27 hours since i make the payment for the recharge and till now your team have no update for me. Why I am being the test subject for your experiments? Why I am paying the cost of your Technical issue or your incapability to provide service? If you can't do the service tell me straight forward and refund my amount, no hard feelings at least in that way I won't be suffering or wasting my time and energy"
65,refund,I have done a recharge which didn't process for 4 days and the customer care executive expects me to wait until it gets processed. Its very bad that a customer has to wait for more than 3 days to get a recharge done. It will be done in seconds in other platforms. Since the recharge was not successful even after 3 days of recharge I expected a refund which was denied by your customer executive.
65,refund,"9/04/22 order date, cancellation on ur own- 14/04/22, refund not received after5 days. Very bad management.Not expected from the concern TATA group."
65,refund,My order ID No TE-1008963743-20220416 has been cancelled on dated 17.04.2022 but not received refund till now
65,refund,Till now my refund was not credited
65,refund,Worst experience ever. My query is still unresolved and my 1mg cash is still not refunded.
65,refund,I did not even ask for refund but the refund process has started
65,refund,"Still, I neither got my refund nor any confirmation"
65,refund,very much disappointed with your service.. its been 3 days since I did a recharge.. still pending.. no refund
65,refund,Because i don't get any refund of my failed transaction
65,refund,"I had placed an order for a large appliance amounting to Rs. 16,191/- on 19.04.2022. For two days I did not get a confirmation on the status of the order and now I am being told that due to a technical glitch the order is being cancelled and my refund is being processed which would take another 4-5 working days to be credited to my bank account. What feedback do you expect me to give? Is my money and my time not worth it. I have lost offer on the order. How are you going to make up for all these things? Please be kind enough and let me know the answers to these questions also"
65,refund,"I'm dissatisfied with the service provided to me. Even after paying money online, I had to wait for 3 days just to get a response form query. I didn't waited for 3 days just to get a refund. How do I recommend this app to someone else when even employees of Tata group are facing these kind of issues."
65,refund,"My issue was I didn't get any email or SMS regarding order confirmation and tracking details after payment is made successfully. Even after 48 hrs none of customer care representative has information regarding my queries. I could see only details of transaction in my transactions section of Tata Neu app, but nothing is available in my orders section regarding that order. On email communication with customer care of Croma as well as Tata Neu also information required is not provided to me. Wrong emails were sent to me about refund will be processed, even though I didn't requested for refund. Overall nothing is inline, nobody has information available regarding order details and status, hence I am not able to track my order. Even after login into my account at Croma website, details regarding my order not available there too. I am having very very bad experience with my first ever order from Tata Neu app."
65,refund,Kindly initiate refund and first experience was worst
65,refund,"Worst service,worst app, i will delete this app, once my refund is back"
65,refund,"Still concern is not resolved. Got a mail from croma that i will get refund, but customer care on tata neu are not aware."
65,refund,"My refund is stuck for around 20 days, No confirmation regarding success of return and initiation of refund.. Worst possible service."
65,refund,Tata Neu took money. Then cancelled order citing 'Technical Issues' 2 days after. Money not yet refunded. Pathetic experience
65,refund,"Your staff is good for nothing -- since last 4 days they keep repeating same copy paste statements -- sorry -- wait for 72 hours -- wait for 72 hours -- every day same statement -- even after 4 days we chat and same statement -- wait for 72 hours...

65,refund,"The fact that Tata Neu only reached out to me after 4 chat message discussions with customer service reps and 1 call itself says a lot worse about Tata Neu CS. I also have an inkling to why this could be happening. When I first palced a replacement request no one listened..and when I asked for cancellation and refund it was immediately picked up within 12 hours. 1. You never had a replacement product. 2. You knew that this product was substandard (pack was June 2020. i,.e almost 2 yr old lying unsold in a godown in gujarat) and hence it was offered at an attractive price to clear it off. 3. Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works..Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service . Request to let it reach the head of CS. Tata Neu didnt live up to Neu. Nothing new in Neu."

So I initiated the chat. I was informed that refund request was noted. However, no text or email confirmation was received till I logged on to Tata Cliq website after 2-3 days.

65,refund,Not solved the issues . Amout not refund
65,refund,I have not got the refund as 10 days are passed from refund initiation and after 8 days again I got mesaage of refund initiation which vulgar experience. Totally bad Tata Services.

65,refund,"My issue stands unresolved. Neu has taken away one Mother Dairy Curd ordered on 28th April. Since then, I have spoken to Tata Neu and Bigbasket help line. Both were groping in the dark. Surprised to note that the good experience at the start turned out to be a nightmare. Issue is not the Curd or Rs. 47.25; it's the lack of coordination and problem solving. The delivery boy said that the item was spoilt/ bad. So refund would be initiated. Wonder! How the new app can be botched up by some, so soon. Not in conformity with Tata experience!!!!"

I have called you so many times and complaint so many times, every time you said 24 to 48 hours but no refund. Please process my second refund as soon as possible. Please Complaint number which i did many times SR05052202664-5 MAY SR09052201352-9 MAY SR24052201714-24 MAY"
