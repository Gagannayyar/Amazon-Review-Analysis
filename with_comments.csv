In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

I did so. He replied and told that the issue will be resolved soon. But it didn't. 1. Issues should be addressed on time. 2. He was polite but the result was zero. 3. No customer will wait so long. 4. If you want to compete with Flipkart and Amazon the customer care should be quick and effective. Eg: The rate at which swiggy initiate refund is impressive. 5. I liked the use of WhatsApp. It's unique. But unfortunately he couldn't open the pics I sent. I don't know why. It kind of destroyed my mood to do business with you. 6. The customer care service should be seamless and he shouldn't be tired of waiting for your response. 7.

When I first palced a replacement request no one listened. and when I asked for cancellation and refund it was immediately picked up within 12 hours. 1. You never had a replacement product. 2. You knew that this product was substandard (pack was June 2020. i,. e almost 2 yr old lying unsold in a godown in gujarat) and hence it was offered at an attractive price to clear it off. 3. Yet it was sold as new. 4. If you had a replacement product (for which I was eleigible and I had even asked for) then you would have immediately categered for it. Check now the prices of this model is rs. 9999/- which you were aware of so were waiting till I get irritated and ask for cancellation & for a refund. I knew how this industry works. Just that Ididnt expect a Tata Company to behave like all others. Since you have I wil not treat you with the same respect as earlier. Its been a very unsavoury experience on the service part. Since I dont want to complain and share my experience on social media as I still love the brand Tata, the least I can do is share here with the customer service .

He spoke in a regional language-hindi. I asked him to speak in english or give to someone who knows english so I can communicate easily. He refused and disconnected the call(after 2-3 attempts). First thing i guess there is insufficient people in the call service team since all the 4-5 times the same person spoke and second thing the person attending should sound polite or atleast sound professional. More than anything ""service"" is something important, which makes the customer visit again. If its not improved, then its difficult to sustain in the competitive environment.

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website.

Even though it says one app for all. every service has its own data and same info needs to be provided to each service 5. I gave an order on big basket and it had high delivery charge so I dint do payment . My order was still taken with a message that they converted my order to CoD. But worse part was when I tried to cancel the order it said I canâ€™t do it for 15 mins for god knows what reason. I let the person come and told him i donâ€™t want the order. Then the csr calls again saying agent is waiting on me.

My review on invoice :- I have not found any option in ordered section of the app where I can download my invoice of my product. The invoice which I gave got from Tata Neu is not in any downloadable format eg:- PDF or word etc. So I hope, In the next update  
I can see invoice features and lag free experience.

Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution.

Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details.

What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID . In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details.

Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure. What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch. What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID . In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue. As the 500 Neu Coins are â€œTataNeu Welcome NeuCoinsâ€ Request you to credit the same as soon as possible.

(Ticket Id#438417) Dear TataDigital Team, When I tried to register on the Tata Neu app it said ""hey you are already registered"" then I called up the help line to know that my TCS ID pandey. vikas3@tcs. com has been registered by ""Mayank Hooda"". My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4. Why it for the golden copy that my other accounts of Big Basket (exiting) connected by my mobile number changed to corporate ID Thank you & Regards, Vikas Pandey From: TataNeu Sent: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 7:15 PM To: VIKAS PANDEY Subject: Help us serve you better.

I did so. He replied and told that the issue will be resolved soon. But it didn't. 1. Issues should be addressed on time. 2. He was polite but the result was zero. 3. No customer will wait so long. 4. If you want to compete with Flipkart and Amazon the customer care should be quick and effective. Eg: The rate at which swiggy initiate refund is impressive. 5. I liked the use of WhatsApp. It's unique. But unfortunately he couldn't open the pics I sent. I don't know why. It kind of destroyed my mood to do business with you. 6. The customer care service should be seamless and he shouldn't be tired of waiting for your response. 7.

Though her role in bringing an end to an issue which was pending for three months is not clear. Also when the ticket communication is sent to the customer, it really pained me to see words like customer is Irate. why would I not be irate. The neu team debited my card, but did not make the booking, did not communicate despite me raising the issue on time. There was no context given to the middle teams. I have spoken to atleast 25 people form the team and spent endless hours which I could have devoted to more productive activities, All in all TATA neu app sucks, is slow, if something goes sideways no one takes responsibility and run around like headless chickens.

Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure. What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch. What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID . In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

9,customer care,"Just giving temporary assurance and actually not resolving the complaint is not enough (my personal experience regarding CROMA), you really have to work towards improving customer care. Not to ignore that there are alot of technical problems in TATA NEU app. TATA Pay : Once it showed that UPI payment was failed. But actually bank SMS was telling transaction was successful and receiver had got that amount. Since that day I stopped using TATA PAY. Also improve the transaction receipt which was shown at end of successful UPI payment. Bcoz receiver gets confused by the current receipt.

My review on invoice :- I have not found any option in ordered section of the app where I can download my invoice of my product. The invoice which I gave got from Tata Neu is not in any downloadable format eg:- PDF or word etc. So I hope, In the next update  
I can see invoice features and lag free experience.

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website.

I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure. What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch. What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID . In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

When the app didn't respond, I was informed that it takes only three characters and the name will have to be changed by calling customer care. I called customer care and had Mr. Mahesh attend the call who was very receptive. He asked me to email my Adhar Card and then issued me a ""ticket"". This email was sent at 7 PM and at 12.54 AM I received an email from Mr. Amit Shah asking me to send a Government Approved ID. This was most strange as this email was in response to the email in which I had sent the Adhar Card as an attachment. On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there. This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further.",0.08249999999999999

10,app,"Customer service needs to be more swift. Hope in the future the service would be more quick and the app becomes more smoother without any lag and no payment issues. I would like to highlight one thing - Customer care call service is pathetic , it must be improved. 4 - 5 times I placed a call, one single guy took the call every time. He spoke in a regional language-hindi. I asked him to speak in english or give to someone who knows english so I can communicate easily. He refused and disconnected the call(after 2-3 attempts). First thing i guess there is insufficient people in the call service team since all the 4-5 times the same person spoke and second thing the person attending should sound polite or atleast sound professional. More than anything ""service"" is something important, which makes the customer visit again. If its not improved, then its difficult to sustain in the competitive environment. That too being from India's PROUD ""TATA"" brand, I wish to see this platform grow thousandfold and flourish successfully. So, please work on the customer service and improve the platform's issues/glitches that is present currently. from a RATAN TATA's Fan",0.1867494824016563

Pathetic and most harrowing experience. You guys need to go a long long way to be in competition with such careless customer service. God bless you.

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution.

The list of service request (437707, 438417, 432141, 488218, 488219 and 495159) and trailing e mails. I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey. vikas3@tcs. com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey. vikas3@tcs. com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action. Regards, Vikas From: VIKAS PANDEY Sent: Friday, March 11, 2022 8:39 AM To: TataNeu Subject: RE: In reference to 488219 Dear Sweta Kumari, Please donâ€™t thank me for my patience and inconvenience since 1st Feb 2022 (last one month 10 days), do you think I did not know that when I joined â€œwe also regret to inform you that 500 NeuCoins cannot be credited in your account as you have logged in 01 Feb 2022.â€ I understand sarcasm is hard to get, so saying it as it is â€œVery bad customer serviceâ€. I am aghast to know â€œWe understand that due to some technical issue you got that error but we have done the required changes in your TataNeu profileâ€. I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure. What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch. What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID .

My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further.",0.08249999999999999

On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there. This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further.",0.08249999999999999

I canâ€™t get my invoice through the app 2. Chat agents randomly change in between and u have to explain everything again. Even after that they donâ€™t do anything to solve ur issue 3. Chat by itself is problematic. The agent asks u for an order number when u go to search the order the chat gets hidden and somehow u have to navigate to come back to chat 4. Even though it says one app for all. every service has its own data and same info needs to be provided to each service 5. I gave an order on big basket and it had high delivery charge so I dint do payment . My order was still taken with a message that they converted my order to CoD. But worse part was when I tried to cancel the order it said I canâ€™t do it for 15 mins for god knows what reason. I let the person come and told him i donâ€™t want the order. Then the csr calls again saying agent is waiting on me.

Though her role in bringing an end to an issue which was pending for three months is not clear. Also when the ticket communication is sent to the customer, it really pained me to see words like customer is Irate. why would I not be irate. The neu team debited my card, but did not make the booking, did not communicate despite me raising the issue on time. There was no context given to the middle teams. I have spoken to atleast 25 people form the team and spent endless hours which I could have devoted to more productive activities, All in all TATA neu app sucks, is slow, if something goes sideways no one takes responsibility and run around like headless chickens.

12,support,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address. Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey. vikas3@tcs. com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey. vikas3@tcs. com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure. What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch. What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID . In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

However, my issue was need to know why the above mentioned order was not delivered on time & why people are not updating. Due to this reason Amazon is doing better business than TATA. Why can't I rely on TATA. area of improvements are as follows:
1. Team should update order status on time
2. Customer care executive should be provided detailed information about logistic part
3. They should have ability to connect with internal team to know real cause of the issue
4. Your customer relationship manager must review each & call to know what is happening at ground level
5. TCS should upgarde their software according to business requirements must provide escalation matrix in the NEU apps",0.16785714285714287
13,update,"Tata Neu is a great app but it will become superapp when it runs superfast speed. I am telling that because the app does not run smoothly.  
In electronics section, sometimes it runs good not very good but sometimes not. Sometimes entrie app goes on slow mode. I have been feeling laggy experience on Tata Neu. To compete with e-commerce giant , Tata nue will have to be smooth, lag free. 

My review on invoice :- I have not found any option in ordered section of the app where I can download my invoice of my product. The invoice which I gave got from Tata Neu is not in any downloadable format eg:- PDF or word etc. So I hope, In the next update  
I can see invoice features and lag free experience.

I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey. vikas3@tcs. com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey. vikas3@tcs. com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

I am aghast to know â€œWe understand that due to some technical issue you got that error but we have done the required changes in your TataNeu profileâ€. I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure. What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch. What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID . In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4.

14,resolve,"Support staff Ms. Kalyani More was supportive and she did resolved my concern at first place. But I am disappoint with the website developers of Tata Neu and Croma website. I still dont understand that why a customer itself cant change their own email address. Second thing, the website doesnt support _ (underscore) which I was facing issue. Since my email id has an underscore (_) and your website doesnt support that. For once, I thought that I am still in 1890's or 1990's where i am using an outdated technology. 

From a brand like Tata, this is not expected to build such kind of website. Making just a good user interface (UI) and attracting customers is not going to help you but there are other miscellaneous things like this my case which you need to realize and figure out the solution. Else, no one is going to use your website for 2nd time then.

Thanks and good support staff. I appreciate for atleast one thing and that is for customer executive called and resolved my issue. Only that part was good. Using your website and facing this kind of glitch experience is not good.",0.2513888888888889

I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey. vikas3@tcs. com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey. vikas3@tcs. com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure. What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch. What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID . In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue.

He spoke in a regional language-hindi. I asked him to speak in english or give to someone who knows english so I can communicate easily. He refused and disconnected the call(after 2-3 attempts). First thing i guess there is insufficient people in the call service team since all the 4-5 times the same person spoke and second thing the person attending should sound polite or atleast sound professional. More than anything ""service"" is something important, which makes the customer visit again. If its not improved, then its difficult to sustain in the competitive environment.
