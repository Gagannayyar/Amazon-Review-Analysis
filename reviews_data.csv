5,"Batch No.: STP062219This is my first experience of OnlyLeaf Green Tea. The thing I liked the most about this is that they have Whole Leaf. And adding Turmeric, Ginger & Tulsi to Green Tea surely enhances its Goodness greatly. This combination is helpful in Boosting Immune Power and improves our body's defence mechanism. So I appreciate this idea of adding healthy stuff to green tea. One should note that the flavor of this green tea is bland and it doesn't have any taste of the various products added in it. It tastes just like normal green tea. I didn't mind this as overall this tea is very good for health. Also its good that they did not add any Artificial Flavouring substances to make the green tea tasty.PS: OnlyLeaf should make sure that the GLUE they use to attach Thread on Tea bag is EDIBLE & is simply NOT ordinary glue which usually have Dangerous chemicals in it. Or they could simply remove the thread itself as one can easily remove the tea bag with a spoon after its soaking time. Also, as another user pointed out here (https://www.amazon.in/review/R14SVPJ3LY4M5I/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07D9TB5JG), there should NOT be tea bag cloth coming out of the edges as is the case in my tea bags too.","Batch No.: STP062219This is my first experience of OnlyLeaf Green Tea.

9,"Amongst the several other brands that I have tried, Only leaf really stands out in terms of taste, user experience, presentation, packaging, and overall branding. There is a really intense taste to the tea, it leaves a very underlying sweet taste in your mouth. The package is so cute! Even the shape of the tea bag is such that it doesn't float above the water, it sinks perfectly. I have tried a lot of flavors, each one is really natural and raw, it doesn't  have an artificial taste like most other brands. So if you choose the ginger tea, you will have a very strong natural taste to it, like a home-made adrak tea.And yes, it does come with two extra free sachets and two veryyy cute honey sachets! <3","Amongst the several other brands that I have tried, Only leaf really stands out in terms of taste, user experience, presentation, packaging, and overall branding.

10,"I liked the taste of this green tea. Good quality product. Tea Bag is made of some sort of fabric and not paper, which I liked. A tea infused with the goodness of medicinal properties along with the clean aspect of onlyleaf . The only leaf concept of having full leaves in a see-through gauze which when dipped into hot water infuses the strong aroma of tulsi and ginger, in the tea which is surely worthy of talking about.","I liked the taste of this green tea.

13,"I really loved this green tea.  It's actually less bitter than the green tea brands I have tried - tetly, Lipton and tea monk. And gives a subtle taste of ginger & turmeric. You could actually see through the leaves and small pieces of ginger & turmeric inside the pyramid pouch.It is soothing indeed to have a cup of tea. Though I am not a big fan of mint green tea I got them as free samples, even they were not as strong flavoured so I was ok. But yeah I won't prefer them.The nylon pyramid pouches gives it a premium appearance.Overall a good experience with ginger& turmeric, & hv ordered another flavour to try.","I really loved this green tea.

19,"The ingredients are absolutely good and immune boosting. Although the taste maynot be too favourable but it's a good start for the day.

20,The turmeric and tulsi fresh natural flavours are released as soon as the tea bag is immersed. The tea flavour is a bit strong. It could have been made lighter to avoid accentuating the bitterness of the turmeric. The packaging is good and retains freshness. My only worry is that the material used for the tea bags may not be biodegradable. Need to check this.,The turmeric and tulsi fresh natural flavours are released as soon as the tea bag is immersed.

25,"The packaging of this product is simple and that was pleasing enough, but what pleased me even more was that the pyramid shaped tea bags were made of some sort of fabric that let you see the ingredients in them and did not leave my tea tasting of paper!I love this variant for my early mornings or when I feel a little under the weather. The ginger and turmeric (Actual pieces of ginger and turmeric that you can see through your tea bag) along with the tulsi, steeped in hot water reminds me of my grandmothers quick fixes for a sore throat.At the same time, it is light and doesn't taste medicinal.","The packaging of this product is simple and that was pleasing enough, but what pleased me even more was that the pyramid shaped tea bags were made of some sort of fabric that let you see the ingredients in them and did not leave my tea tasting of paper.

29,"I found this whole leaf tea quite a welcome change from the regular CTC tea, in that it retains the full-bodied original aroma and flavor of the tea. There was no lingering bitterness and the unique packaging of the bags allowed optimal diffusion into the water.","I found this whole leaf tea quite a welcome change from the regular CTC tea, in that it retains the full-bodied original aroma and flavor of the tea.

30,"There are some cuts on nylon bags where the tea leaves, ginger etc., are coming out.In my opinion, if Tulsi flavor is increased little more then the taste will be more good and refreshing.","There are some cuts on nylon bags where the tea leaves, ginger etc., are coming out.

31,"The turmeric ginger tea is awesome. They packed leaves into little packets and sent it, which makes it awesome. There is no tea dust, no grains, and is minimally processed.

32,"I have tried both the Hibiscus and turmeric green tea. They are definitely not bad, but I think a couple of improvements could really change the green tea experience. First off the green tea content seems less compared to the other ingredients in the tea bag. You can taste the Turmeric, Hibiscus, clove but it's overbearing and kills the green tea taste. Also the tea bag is stuck with some glue to the thread which in hot water just doesn't seem right.","I have tried both the Hibiscus and turmeric green tea.
