Thanks and Regards, Priyanka Naidu TataNeu Customer Care 655948:1499020 Dear Sweta Kumari, I am really annoyed by the customer service done by Tata Neu. The list of service request (437707, 438417, 432141, 488218, 488219 and 495159) and trailing e mails. I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey.vikas3@tcs.com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

I am aghast to know â€œWe understand that due to some technical issue you got that error but we have done the required changes in your TataNeu profileâ€. I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure? What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch? What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue. As the 500 Neu Coins are â€œTataNeu Welcome NeuCoinsâ€ Request you to credit the same as soon as possible.

(Ticket Id#438417) Dear TataDigital Team, When I tried to register on the Tata Neu app it said \"hey you are already registered\" then I called up the help line to know that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com has been registered by \"Mayank Hooda\". My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4. Why it for the golden copy that my other accounts of Big Basket (exiting) connected by my mobile number changed to corporate ID Thank you & Regards, Vikas Pandey From: TataNeu Sent: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 7:15 PM To: VIKAS PANDEY Subject: Help us serve you better.

      "I am really sad to learn the pathetic service from Tata Neu whether its customer care executive or your delivery partner. If you cannot provide me the service than why the hell you take the order and money. You have my address and every other detail , and you should first ascertain the fact first. I need the mobile on very urgent basis but because of your poor and degraded service i am unable to get it now and more so my money is also blocked which i cant use to purchase from some where else. Thanks and regards. My only advise would be to improve your self  bcoz this sought of harassments would really affect the reputation of your brand Tata Neu\n",
      "Tata Neu and its affiliates have to really work hard on bring their return process to a level where you can really compete with the likes of Amazon. Your logistics partner Ekart is really bad when it comes to picking up a product. I placed two return requests on April 22 and they got picked yesterday. I wasted my whole weekend waiting for Ekart's executive to pick up my stuff and NO ONE turned up. This is highly disappointing. To top it off the customer service executive very calmly said it normally takes 3 working days to pick a product from data of initiation. Disappointed to the max.\n",

What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch? What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue. Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action. As the 500 Neu Coins are â€œTataNeu Welcome NeuCoinsâ€ Request you to credit the same as soon as possible. My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3.

I called up Bigbasket and they confirmed that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com is linked to Mayank Hooda I am surprised for last 2 months you all have not taken/reported any action against Mayank Hooda. Please take legal action against Mayank Hooda (mobile 7015917384) he seems to be a scamster and fraudster, I will support and help with all the details. Aside: Bigbasket Tata Neu is not customer centric, not secure, validation and mismanaging unique field platform please get them to upgrade their service platform ( Security / Validation and Information) also Request to correct my details in your systems Name: Vikas Pandey change from Mayank Hooda Connected E Mail ID : pandey.vikas3@tcs.com Please find the trailing e mails for reference and to take action.

I am aghast to know â€œWe understand that due to some technical issue you got that error but we have done the required changes in your TataNeu profileâ€. I had clearly explained the case to at least 5 associates from Tata Digital (that is level of Customer Centric operations) this is the response. Great. Now please let me know What is the customers fault of the customer in your system security process failure? What is the customers fault when you do the technical mismatch? What is the customers fault when you donâ€™t validate the name / e mail ID ? In the inadequate third-class registration system ( in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) of yours I have cooperated by sharing my Aadhar card as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey, Follow up with your pathetic tele sales associates who all are inept to corelate simple things like e mails / tickets shared earlier, background of the case and no inclination to resolve the issue. As the 500 Neu Coins are â€œTataNeu Welcome NeuCoinsâ€ Request you to credit the same as soon as possible.

(Ticket Id#438417) Dear TataDigital Team, When I tried to register on the Tata Neu app it said \"hey you are already registered\" then I called up the help line to know that my TCS ID pandey.vikas3@tcs.com has been registered by \"Mayank Hooda\". My few questions to the application team (by the way they have done a pathetic job in terms of security, validation and mismanaging unique field in this case it is Tata Company e mail ID) 1. What kind of validation was done to have name and corporate e mail ID mismatch and create a login 2. How was Mayanks ID created without OTP 3. My Aadhar card was taken as proof of Identity for changing the name from Mayank Hooda to Vikas Pandey then how was the ID named Mayank without any proof 4. Why it for the golden copy that my other accounts of Big Basket (exiting) connected by my mobile number changed to corporate ID Thank you & Regards, Vikas Pandey From: TataNeu Sent: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 7:15 PM To: VIKAS PANDEY Subject: Help us serve you better.

I gave an order on big basket and it had high delivery charge so I dint do payment . My order was still taken with a message that they converted my order to CoD. But worse part was when I tried to cancel the order it said I canâ€™t do it for 15 mins for god knows what reason. I let the person come and told him i donâ€™t want the order.

Though her role in bringing an end to an issue which was pending for three months is not clear. Also when the ticket communication is sent to the customer, it really pained me to see words like customer is Irate. why would I not be irate? The neu team debited my card, but did not make the booking, did not communicate despite me raising the issue on time. There was no context given to the middle teams. I have spoken to atleast 25 people form the team and spent endless hours which I could have devoted to more productive activities, All in all TATA neu app sucks, is slow, if something goes sideways no one takes responsibility and run around like headless chickens. Or do not offer the resolution one needs. IF you are creating a payment portal, at least ensure governance, and try to help the customer.

      "I visited the Croma store at Vasant Kunj to purchase two Voltas Air Conditioners. I requested the bill to be made with my GST so I could claim the benefit. While making the bill I was informed that they couldn't enter my full name as the records, entered by someone at a Croma store while making a purchase earlier, had been registered with just my surname. What started then was a process that would put even the most leaden-footed bureaucracies to shame. First I was told to download the TATA Neu app and asked to change my name there. When the app didn't respond, I was informed that it takes only three characters and the name will have to be changed by calling customer care. I called customer care and had Mr. Mahesh attend the call who was very receptive. He asked me to email my Adhar Card and then issued me a \"ticket\". This email was sent at 7 PM and at 12.54 AM I received an email from Mr. Amit Shah asking me to send a Government Approved ID. This was most strange as this email was in response to the email in which I had sent the Adhar Card as an attachment. On calling customer care I was told by Ms. Simran that the Adhar card had not been received. When I asked her to check the mail trail she acknowledged the fact that the Adhar Card was indeed there! This entire episode highlights alarming lacunae in the processes followed by Croma and the TATA team. First was the sheer laziness on part of the Croma employee who did not fill in my details in the records properly thus putting the onus completely on the customer, namely me, to get the mistake rectified. The second more appalling one was how two different executives from customer service FAILED to notice the attachment sent delaying the rectification further.\n",

I also emailed a video (which I had to make as this thing has he opened earlier to me also) to the customer care team. It clearly shows I have purchased from Tata neu, still the customer care is disagreeing an saying that I have purchased from Croma website. If you see my history of purchases, I have been buying a lot of items from Tata neu. I am not happy with the current status of my problem. Tata neu has less varieties and higher costs in some items, still supporting the app as itâ€™s made in India. But if the customer care wonâ€™t support properly, I am not likely to suggest this to my friends. Thanks.\n",
